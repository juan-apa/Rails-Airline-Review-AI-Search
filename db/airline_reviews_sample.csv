Singapore Airlines,"Flight was amazing. The crew onboard this flight were very welcoming, and gave a good atmosphere. The crew serving my aisle goes by the initial “G”. She was very kind & helpful. Gave my mom a bday cake for a late celebration even though it was just a 1hr 45min flight. Seat is well sanitized, legroom is spacious. IFE onboard has many variety of shows, music, etc. Bathroom always kept clean by crew at all times. & Food was delicious, overall this flight is a 9/10",Flight was amazing
Singapore Airlines,Booking an emergency exit seat still meant huge discomfort in a seat far too narrow and poor padding meaning back ache in 90 minute flight. The seats on this aircraft are dreadful. The headphones and sound on the entertainment system was dreadful.,seats on this aircraft are dreadful
Singapore Airlines,Excellent performance on all fronts. I would definitely choose to use this airline again. The aircraft is well-maintained and the staff well-trained on hospitality. Food was plentiful and tasty.,Food was plentiful and tasty
Singapore Airlines,"Pretty comfortable flight considering I was flying in economy class in one of the older aircraft in their fleet which is still kept in relatively good condition. The economy class cabin was in a 3-3-3 configuration and the flight was almost full. What amazed me most was how much food was available for economy passengers - 2 full meals and the rear galley was stocked with snacks. The crew came round regularly with trays of drinks and juice through the flight. I disembarked with a very full stomach! The timing of main meals and the lighting/dimming of the cabin were done sensitively. The cabin crew seemed willing to please, it makes interactions pleasant and the whole experience that bit more enjoyable. Eye-masks were not handed out but were provided upon request. The economy class toilets were stocked with complimentary toothbrushes. Wifi was supposedly free but didn't seem to work for the duration of the flight. However, there was a diverse choice of movies and TV programmes.",“how much food was available
Singapore Airlines,"The service was consistently good from start to finish. The cabin crew showcased the friendly Singaporean culture at its finest. It seemed like they really cared for the passengers, which is what I liked the most. The seat was comfortable and wide range of movies was provided (too many to choose from even!)",“service was consistently good”
Singapore Airlines,"This flight was over six hours long on a B737 MAX8. I booked an emergency exit row seat by the window. The seat is absolutely dreadful. Lacks padding, and within a few hours, developed back ache that lasted for several days after the flight. The left and right armrests effectively reduce the working seat width to 12 inches. The B737 MAX is not fit for purpose for long haul flights and I would recommend that you do fly on this aircraft unless its for a flight duration of no more than 2 hours. Most passengers I spoke to by the end of the flight were also having back aches too. The flight also run out of wine and beer before they had completed serving the lunch so inflight service also very poor indeed. The sound on the entertainment system was also poor and the earphones kept falling out of your ears.",“seat is absolutely dreadful”
Singapore Airlines,"Boarding process went smoothly, and plane left on time. I had a window seat in the first part of economy section. The plane has 3-4-3 layout. We were 3 adults on this row, and it was very narrow. When the passenger in front of me, reclined his seat, i could hardly look at my screen, and could not fold out the table. The crew told people to raise up the seat backs during the meal times. We had two meals, dinner and breakfast, both meals were ok. I wanted to charge my phone during the flight, usb charger wad not working. I remember many years ago, when travelling with Singapore Airlines, the drink trolley came before the meal, and again when you got the meal, and they showed up again shortly after the meal also. Now you just get drinks along with the meal, and they do not ask if you want a refill. Very ordinary service and not very friendly staff either.",Very ordinary service
Singapore Airlines,Pleasant flight which operated on time. Check-in at Changi was smooth and assistance given to me since I didn’t know how to use the check-in kiosk and bag drop. Lunch was provided onboard and advanced special meal requests were catered for appropriately. I like flying this airline.,I like flying this airline
Singapore Airlines,"I embarked on a journey with high hopes and anticipation, having secured a connecting flight ticket from Penang to Singapore, and then onwards to Jakarta. Opting for Singapore Airlines, renowned for its outstanding reputation in both air travel and service, I anticipated nothing less than a seamless experience. The cost of this connecting flight amounted to MYR 1601, roughly USD 335, a price I was more than willing to pay for quality service. My journey commenced with a minor delay in takeoff from Penang. The flight proceeded smoothly, accompanied by a light snack comprising a slice of pizza and a beverage of choice. As we approached Changi Airport, the situation took an unexpected turn. The captain announced a delay in landing, estimating an additional 15 to 20 minutes before touchdown. A sense of unease crept over me as my connecting flight departure time loomed closer. Despite my concerns, I remained optimistic, trusting in the efficiency of Singapore Airlines to navigate any challenges seamlessly. Upon landing at 12:05 pm and disembarking at 12:18 pm, I was met with a startling realization. Rather than a smooth transition to my connecting flight, I was handed a new ticket, rescheduled for departure at 4:10 pm, accompanied by a SGD 15 food voucher for Burger King and Coffee Bean.  I sought clarity from the attendant, only to be met with dismissiveness. The absence of any acknowledgment or attempt at redress left me deeply disappointed. The disregard for my time and the indifferent handling of the situation underscored a gap in the airline's commitment to customer service. In retrospect, my expectation for exemplary hospitality and proactive problem-solving from a reputed airline like Singapore Airlines was regrettably unmet. As I reflect on this experience, I am reminded of the importance of genuine care and consideration in customer service, particularly in moments of inconvenience or distress.",left me deeply disappointed
Singapore Airlines,"No queue at check-in, and boarding at the gate was done in an orderly fashion by zones. Pleasant greeting from crew on boarding. The flight was full but cabin crew worked hard to serve lunch to everyone satisfactorily. Great inflight entertainment options for a short-haul flight— far better than any equivalent flights available within Europe for example. Flight landed on time, disembarkation was quick and luggage delivered to the belt quickly as well. I can’t fault a single aspect of the flight.",can’t fault a single aspect
Singapore Airlines,Competitive pricing on this route. Service is reliable and friendly. Flight was on time and all aspects went smoothly. No complaints at all and would recommend to others.,No complaints at all
Singapore Airlines,"This was my first time flying on a regional Singapore Airlines flight on a narrow-bodied aircraft since the old subsidiary Silk Air was absorbed by the parent carrier, and I was impressed. Everything went well on the flight, from boarding, to exemplary behaviour and courtesy shown by the cabin crew, to the food and boarding process at Changi airport. The inflight entertainment provided was the full product used for their long haul flights — amazing!",“I was impressed”
Singapore Airlines,Superb service even in economy class. Nothing was too much trouble for the cabin crew. Good food and plentiful. Ample choice of entertainment. Flight departed late but still arrived a little early. Boarding at Heathrow was a little chaotic however.,“Superb service”
Singapore Airlines,"I was one of the last business class passengers to board, Went to my seat and no offer of pre departure drinks or hot towel. Japanese FA came to me and confirmed my meal order and informed me lunch service would start around 1130am. We took off about 0830am, after takeoff lights were dimmed and nothing was offered. From the time the aircraft took off to the start of lunch service around 11am I did not see crew in the cabin and nothing was offered for 2 1/2 hours. Lunch started with a drink order of orange juice. What came was a syrupy kind of orange drink like cordial. Meal service was fine but this set of crew was just not SQ standard. The regional seat was really uncomfortable and cramped. I did not like it and prefer the older long haul seat.",regional seat was really uncomfortable
Singapore Airlines,"I flew Perth to Hong Kong via Singapore on SQ226/896 business class on 17/18 January. The first sector was faultless, the crew attentive, no rush with the meal service and a crew member always wandering around the business cabin checking on passengers, topping up drinks etc. magnificent. The next sector started well with friendly and attentive crew, however, after the meal service the entire crew serving business disappeared and were only seen if the bell was rung! A shame because this now seems to be the norm. Rush the meals, dim the lights and hide!",crew serving business disappeared
Singapore Airlines,"For my final trip booked for July 2024, Singapore cancelled my return flight from Istanbul to Sydney. Both the travel agent and I have been trying to get in touch via phone, sms and online forms and they are not responding at all. The travel agent no longer wants to know after a month and a half of trying, they sent me an email for me to try direct, Singapore will not speak to me despite my telling them the agent has wiped his hands of it. Today I found out I will not get my full refund if I were to cancel because the agent took out travel insurance on my behalf without advising me at all. I always have my own travel insurance why would I need another.",agent took out travel insurance on my behalf
Singapore Airlines,"Booked a wheelchair service from Milan to Bangkok. Apart from a slight mishap in Singapore this was one of the best flights I have ever had. The quality of the service was outstanding. Crew worked throughout unlike many European airlines, with great attentiveness. I know because I never sleep. The quality of the food was superb. From my experience both Singapore airlines and Thai have the best training I have come across. Very good entertainment system with many choices. As a yearly flyer there is nothing better than having a long flight where everything works smoothly and people care about you. I can only say thank you. I appreciate your hard work. I will be flying with you again later this year.",one of the best flights
Singapore Airlines,"I initially booked two separate flights for this airline in November. The first was a LHR-SIN-LHR flight and another was a SIN-MNL-SIN flight. To cut the story short, I requested to rebook my LHR-SIN flight two weeks ahead of my scheduled flight due to a family bereavement and I needed to be in the Philippines. Despite my personal situation, I received an amazing support from the Customer Service team, who happily reorganised my flight, connected my 2 flight bookings so I can get to Manila on time, and without rebooking fees. At the London airport, I was sent-off warmly by the ground staff who has empathised with me as I check-in and ensure I was boarded comfortably in the plane. These gestures of goodwill and support made me grateful for Singapore Airlines. Even though I am no longer based in Singapore, I will always find a way to fly with them. Thank you. These words are never enough for the outstanding, grateful and sincere help you have provided me.",“received amazing support”
Singapore Airlines,"I flew on SQ217 from Singapore to Melbourne on the 4th of January. My flight was terrible. To begin with my seat was broken and couldn’t be moved and the entertainment device was broken as well. My flight of nearly 8 hours was spent looking blankly into space, seated in the same position. I had severe back pain upon arrival as a result for the next couple of days. When I informed the crew, first the steward said I will be compensated with a voucher and asked me to choose what I like from the duty free catalog. When I did choose a product that would be useful for me, I was told by the air hostess that my voucher is only for $75 Singapore dollars and the rest will have to be paid by me! I informed them I don’t need their $75 voucher and that I will make a formal complaint about the plane’s defects. After my return I did make the complaint and they got back to me saying that another travel voucher of AU$200 will be issued to be used in my next flight with Singapore airlines. But the worst part was they lied and said I was offered another seat but I had declined saying I wanted to be seated next to my husband. This was an outrageous lie. At no point did they offer me another seat. This is very concerning. I would urge everyone flying in SQ next time, to either video any exchange with the crew in situations like this or get it in writing. After discussing with my husband, I informed them that I would not be flying with them in the near future so they can give me a cash voucher. But they replied saying they can only give me a voucher to be used for my future bookings through Singapore airlines. I refused to accept it because I will not fly with them in the future. Even a budget airline would have been more comfortable than this flight. But the greatest worry is their dishonesty.",not fly with them in the future
Singapore Airlines,"Barely any room to move, woke up to getting my knee crushed from the passenger in front of me reclining there seat back and was told it’s within their right to do so. Would not recommend flying economy with them if you are 6ft or taller.",Barely any room to move
Singapore Airlines,"Flew on A52 from Singapore to Manchester on the 10 January. The cabin crew on this flight were excellent in providing outstanding service. Food and drinks were plentiful and of very high quality. My only issue was the seating which I found to be uncomfortable, but other than that the flight was superb. Very highly recommended.",“outstanding service”
Singapore Airlines,"Checkin and immigration entry at Changi Airport a breeze, all completed and straight to Business Lounge within 5-10 minutes, Lovely and comfortable lounge at T3 with a vast array of food and beverages. Flight left slightly late due to operational issues but pre flight champagne was served and we were then on our way. I elected to have a meal upon departure ( as this was a 1am flight, but you can elect to have served 2 hours prior to arrival) and was served a very tasty steak and vegetables with some lovely french red wine. Staff then prepared lie down bed for a sleep which was bliss after a long day. Staff very courteous and professional as always , a reasonwhy I will continue to use SQ for all travel given the brilliant experience with this great airline, everytime.",brilliant experience
Singapore Airlines,"We booked our ticket well in advance for our return trip from India from CCU to Perth via Singapore and after few days SIA changed the flight timing later, from originally scheduled 7.40am to 7.20am. We boarded the flight from CCU and flight landed 1 minute before time. Upon landing we have received the notification that our flight has been rescheduled and it will depart at 9.30am. As mentioned before we booked well in advance and paid extra money for forward seats. However with utter surprise we have noticed that they have allocated us three different seats that too rear of the aircraft. While contacting the Transfer desk the customer service lady told us it is not possible to provide us any other seats so that three of us can seat together. She was very rude and not suitable for this kind of job. Being a Krisflyer Gold member this is very disappointing and not at all expected from SIA.",allocated us three different seats
Singapore Airlines,Book early coming 2024 ticket suppose SQ101 launching Jun’24 and now received email say SQ101 is not operating due to operational reason. They suggest swapping my itinerary to one day earlier to SQ127 result long layover time in SIN and aircraft change from Boeing 737-8 to Boeing 737-800NG for real was ex-MI aircraft.,swapping my itinerary to one day earlier
Singapore Airlines,"Book the cook worked well, my seatmate got economy food. There was a bottle of water in every seat, good wifi connectivity. Wines are offered. Frankfurt to Singapore as I moved my seat to bulkhead 25 hours before flying, somehow this messes up the book the cook. So I had eco food. They were apologetic and I received voucher to redeem. I slept better than in economy, and I didn't have swollen leg! I used to try to score business class seat in flights > 10 hours due to my leg tends to swell. But prices now are horrendously expensive. Singapore Airlines premium economy already good enough for my leg.",I slept better than in economy
Singapore Airlines,The customer service is a nightmare. I have spent days on the phone since I booked my flight 2 months ago. I booked a flex fare to be able to reschedule my flight but the homepage is not working - same as the staff on the phone that tells me a different story about why I cannot reschedule every time.  Never again.,customer service is a nightmare
Singapore Airlines,"The experience was very good on both Outbound to Inbound flights. As we travelled Premium Economy we received priority boarding which was good especially as we were travelling with my 80 year old dad. Premium Economy is very good especially the Leg room, which is the main reason I wanted it and being over double some economy fares it satisfied our needs. Extra recline also made a difference and was bearable even when the person in front was reclining. The Premium Economy cabin only has 4 rows 2-4-2 and is separated from the main economy cabin which made it feel more spacious. We chose the back row so nobody behind us made it feel a little more private and a big gap between us and exit room economy in the next cabin. Flight was smooth and comfortable Staff were great. Helpful and very accommodating when needed. Food was good although had the option to Book the Cook prior to flight. I know some airlines are starting to increase leg room to 40 inches SIN (38) which would be great when you consider the extra money that is paid. On our return from Croatia at Frankfurt there were flight delays which meant we would miss our connection from SIN MEL But both Lufthansa an Singapore Airlines made this a much less stressful experience, in fact a great little adventure. At FRA we received meal vouchers and were updated regularly by helpful staff and when we arrived in SIN everything was organised as soon as we got of the plane. Meal vouchers, hotel vouchers, Taxi to hotel and back, assistance with getting our entry visa on arrival. Choose a good airline and the combo of Lufthansa and especially flying major legs with Singapore Airlines made it an easy, comfortable experience. I would highly recommend.","easy, comfortable experience"
Singapore Airlines,"It appears that Singapore Airlines slogan Placing you at the heart of everything we do, only applies when you are actually travelling, any customer service does not extend to dealing with complaints about delays quickly and efficiently. We were delayed 24 hours in September 2023, and are still waiting for the airline to comply with UK civil aviation authority compensation rules.",delayed 24 hours in September 2023
Singapore Airlines,"I used Singapore Airlines on 10 flights during September and October between the UK and different Asian destinations, I have used Singapore many times maintaining Kris flyer Gold Status for some years. During my recent flights I used economy, premium economy and business class, the flights were okay nothing spectacular but probably the biggest take away was the poor service on just about every flight apart from 1. Ranging from missed food to dreadful food, just not the Singapore Airlines I know! I used SQ for the consistency of service which is not after COVID not the same, I know many airlines have suffered from experience leaving the work place, but Singapore crew service and consistency are it's trade mark. I travel to South East Asia a lot from both Europe & South Africa so Singapore figured in my travel plans a lot, I will probably use them again in the future but in the meantime I have gone to an alternative for my next round of flights. I would recommend Singapore on some routes simply because the competition is poor.",“not the Singapore Airlines I know!”
Singapore Airlines,"We had the most horrific check-in experience with Singapore Airlines on Nov. 7th flight SQ 25 from JFK to Frankfurt. The check-in area barely had any travelers when we arrived and we were greeted by an agent immediately. The horror began. Our ticket was a one-way ticket since we were going to Split, Croatia (our final destination) for a longer time period for us and, especially, our toddler boy (29 months old traveling with me and my wife of course) to enjoy time with family and friends. Therefore, we purchased an airline ticket for each of us and chose Singapore Airlines as a well-respected travel provider. Each of us had 2 check-in luggage, one carry-on, one backpack, and a car seat for our son. Leaving for an extended period of time with toddlers requires carrying a lot of luggage and we carefully packed it all, measured it, and tried to pay for extra weight online before flying. There was no option for it. As I was taking care of our son, my wife was checking us in at the counter (the first class counter right next to the business class counter in Row 8). I noticed that she became visibly distressed and that the agent was on the phone holding off the check-in procedure. I asked if everything was ok and she responded that the check-in agent was not letting us check in. What he and his supervisor who he was on the phone with, and who seemed to be a business class agent right next to us, said equals absolute harassment and a complete overstepping of their boundaries. They proceeded to tell us that we needed to purchase a separate return ticket each because we won’t be let in to stay in Croatia. This is unheard of, absolutely wrong, and untrue, a situation created by the agent and his supervisor that doesn’t exist. I am Croatian and an American citizen, and my wife and my son are American citizens who can enter Croatia with American passports as they wish. Then, the agent (still on the phone with the next counter supervisor) asked my wife if she had at least $8000 and after taking my Croatian passport said it would be fine for me but not for my wife who never changed her name - so was asked to produce proof of our marriage. Thankfully she carries our marriage certificate in case of this but for other countries as we travel - not for the US! And this “interrogation“ happened in an atmosphere of hostility where the agent and his supervisor, who at some point was having a laughing chat with one of his colleagues, behaved with utmost disrespect towards us as their/your client/customer. Zero courteous smile. Zero understanding. Zero any sort of empathy that we have a toddler with us. We knew that we would pay for extra weight in one piece of luggage (the 9 kg option we couldn’t do online). They proceeded to make us check our two carry-ons that were barely over 7kg (and this has never happened to me or my wife in our 25 years of global flying) at a cost of $700. The Crew and flight were great. The food was horrible and the seats were not too comfy. Also, the customer service was almost ignorant of our complaint and defended their agents' actions without any understanding. Never again Singapore Airlines.",Never again Singapore Airlines
Singapore Airlines,Just a short 2 hour flight. Food was excellent - had the Pre-Order Butter Chicken. Staff were efficient. Comfy seat but no time to relax back and enjoy. No issues and would fly again.,Food was excellent
Singapore Airlines,An excellent experience. Food was simply terrific (Pan Seared Salmon) and plenty of Drink on offer. Service was Friendly and Efficient. I got a good 7 hours of sleep laid out flat. Also used their complimentary WiFi without any issues.,An excellent experience
Singapore Airlines,"We were booked on Business from Johannesburg to Singapore in October and was asked to provide the credit card used to purchase the ticket for my husband’s ticket some 11 months ago. Apparently this was flagged by SQ system at checkin and we need to provide said credit card for checkin staff to scan into SQ system in order to allow us to get his boarding pass. Otherwise we need to sign an indemnity form or risk denied boarding. Fortunately, I did have the credit card used 11 months ago when I booked his flight or both of us would end up in Johannesburg stranded! Reason offered: 1. Fraud detection systems picked this up based off determined parameters. When I challenged this because 11 months SQ would have been paid in full and their ERP system should have the information. 2. Next explanation: within a 12- hour period we charged many transactions on card. When I provided the data which showed we never charged anything within 12 hour either before or after . 3. Their system algorithm is correct in picking this up as “fraud” and good for customer! Empty assurance of prevention when SQ has not provided any explanation how this event was picked up! I am still waiting for someone more senior to pick this up… Interested to ensure that this will not happen to any other passengers who booked tickets at least 3 months in advance of travel date let alone one year ago!",SQ has not provided any explanation
Singapore Airlines,"The best airline I've flown. The windows shades are automatic dark, automatic colors. The aircraft is big with many lavatories. Wifi is working for Krisflyer members and its free. The IFE is also working with great choices of movies and tv shows and a usb port provided. The breakfast was also great.",great choices of movies
Singapore Airlines,"We were booked in on seat numbers 62j to 62k as a family of four. At the time of the meals, when requested for a chicken meal we were only offered an option of fish or vegetarian. As there was no chicken available, my kids were given a fish meal that they could not eat. I refused a meal, as I was unable to get a chicken meal. What I was given to understand by the head stewardess that there were not enough meals on the flight. What baffles me is how can the earlier economy seats in the plain get what they want, and we as a family in the latter half were not even given one chicken meal. No where on check-in were we given an option to choose our meals too. Even the head stewardess was of the opinion there was an issue with the allocation of meals.",only offered an option of fish or vegetarian
Singapore Airlines,They never placed my 2 bags on my flights from Rome to Singapore and onto Penang. I have airtags and the app shows exactly where they are and Singapore Airlines refuses to use this information and continues to tell me that they cannot find my luggage. I am stranded in Penang with only the clothes on my back. They have completely destroyed this travel experience. I attach a pic of where my bags currently are at Rome airport!,tell me that they cannot find my luggage
Singapore Airlines,"Seats that we paid for and confirmed very much earlier had been unfairly re-assigned later on to another person who was their preferred customer without first obtaining our consent or approval; SIA customer service initially informed us the seat was re=assigned due to flight schedule change but it turned out to be false. When they realized, they were wrong, they subsequently changed their position to cancellation and re-booking of our flight by their customer service agents. We did not cancel the flight but it was an error committed by their customer agent. . When the customer service agent re-booked our flight they ensured us that our original seats selection would be the same. We periodically checked with the customer service agents to ensure that our original seats selection were intact. They confirmed and re-confirmed that our original paid seats were unchanged. We also went on to their on-line booking website to confirm that our original seat selections remained intact. On checking in (2 days before flight), we discovered that one of our paid seats was re-assigned to another customer without our prior knowledge and approval. We discovered our seat was re-assigned to a standard seat to the back of the plane. Immediately. we called the customer service agents immediately on the phone to reinstate our paid seats back but they refused to do it. The customer service agents on the phone did not converse well in English and they gave us all the wrong information about the seat change. It was extremely difficult to get through to them on the phone and we had to wait for a long time before we could speak to someone.  The duty manager at airport informed us our paid seat had been changed last minute due to a preferred customer had kicked us out due to his importance. It was unprofessional and unethical for them to do that. We had to fight and argue fervently all the way through at each encounter. Even at the gate, we had to fight and argue to get our seat back after seeking approval from the preferred customer. Escalated the complaints to the senior management (CEO) several times who did not even respond to our complaints.. Actual costs incurred to resolve the airline mistakes amounted to SGD429.65 and they only agreed to issue a voucher of SGD75 which is inadequate to compensate for the actual costs incurred. Moreover, it does not include the additional inherent cost of lost vacation time and stress/frustrations to deal with their mistakes that they had created for us unnecessarily. Customer service investigation focused mainly on the outcome but do not provide fair customer resolution to their mistakes they had committed. The last response received from the customer service agent was that they are happy with the investigation and no further communication and action would be taken i.e. refused to address their mistakes committed and refused to compensate the costs that we had incurred.",refused to compensate the costs
Singapore Airlines,"I am submitting this review about a terrible experience with Singapore Airlines wherein my family were subject to a 5-hour delay which then caused them to miss their connecting flight and extend the delay to 30+ hours. The delay according to Singapore Airlines was caused by traffic control between Guangzhou and Singapore and the plane had to be diverted to Kuala Lumpur to refuel for more than 2 hours on the tarmac. We missed the connecting flight SQ38 on August 9th to LAX as a result. We were placed in a hotel by SQ adjacent to the airport for a sudden 24hour plus layover near midnight with a food coupon that we had to fight for as we were starving due to the long delay and no food service on the plane. After arriving at the hotel we found out that those food vouchers were not even valid according to the hotel, Capri by Fraser, and no food service was available. Capri by Fraser's on duty manager in Singapore apparently said they don't take food coupons from Singapore Airlines for emergency layover guests and that this was a miscommunication with SQ. At near midnight where nearly all restaurants were closed and Capri is far from the city center, how were we expected to get a meal after being misled by Singapore Airline staff at the airport about the availability of food and their miscommunication? What if we were first time guests in Singapore with no knowledge of the local language and not able to navigate the situation? This is a complete failure from a management perspective as logically delayed passengers who miss a connecting flights after a certain time should at least be informed properly if not put in a hotel with 24 room service/dining options in or nearby and given the courtesy of not having to worry about starving on top of rearranging travel plans etc. For an airline with a world class reputation where one pays a premium for the service this just is not acceptable. I submitted a complaint to Singapore Airlines but their complains team threw a response back at me: “as much as we acknowledge the inconvenience you went through as a result of the delay, as an industry practice, and in line with our Conditions of Contract and Carriage, we would like to share that airlines generally do not compensate for consequential losses or inconvenience arising from flight delays.” However, I know international passenger rights stemming from Article 19 of the Montreal Convention. When I brought this up to an SQ customer service supervisor after spending hours on call trying to reach someone who I could speak to about this, I was shocked and concerned to find out that not even supervisor level reps knew about one of the most important international passenger rights conventions. SQ repeatedly mislead and misrepresent int'l passenger rights trying to brush me off. Currently they have ceased responding to my emails and appears to think that ignoring the issue will fix it. I don't know what more I can do at this point but I hope this review will serve to shed light on the holes in SQ's 5 star service and World's Best Airline reputation. I hope no one has to experience what we experienced during that disastrous layover in Singapore.",disastrous layover in Singapore
Singapore Airlines,It was a good flight. I would have given a full 10 on 10 review but because of the seats I ain't that satisfied. Business class seats should have been more comfortable when travelling long haul flights.,It was a good flight
Singapore Airlines,"Having flown with a few middle east carriers throughout this route, definitely I was putting a high expectations from this SQ flight. Got the best price compare with another middle eastern carriers with extra 300 AED for extra 5kgs checked in luggage. The check in process was smooth and I was lucky enough to get upgraded to premium eco seat from SIN to CGK. The DXB to SIN flight was really bumpy, but the crew was really courteous and helpful throughout the flight. The food was definitely better than the middle eastern carriers and also free wifi was a nice touch comparing to any other airlines. The service was feel more special on SIN to CGK sector though it was a very short flight. Definitely will choose this again (if the price is right, compare to middle eastern carriers). Good job SQ.",crew was really courteous and helpful
Singapore Airlines,"There was nothing special at Frankfurt airport pre-departure. It was good when we got onboard. The seat on SQ 777-300ER is similar to that on the A350-900ULR, meaning it is spacious and comfortable. Catering from Frankfurt was excellent, and I liked all the dishes served, especially the satay (I heard the satay was brought from Singapore, but I was not sure). Cabin crew were very nice and helpful, as expected from SQ.",Cabin crew were very nice and helpful
Singapore Airlines,"The airline's check-in staff charged me an extra $200 for a 10kg backpack, just slightly over the 7kg carry-on limit. This experience was incredibly frustrating and inflexible.",an extra $200 for a 10kg backpack

Singapore Airlines,"I have never come across a company that would ask a customer to pay a penalty fee for switching from a cheaper to a more expensive service. I bought a one way Economy class ticket from the US to Singapore at first, planning to take another airline for the other leg of the trip. Being a loyal customer of Singapore Airlines, I decided to be more generous and pay a lot more to buy a 2-way Business class trip in place for the original one-way Economy class ticket. I cancelled the one-way Economy class ticket after buying the 2-way Business class ticket and found that Singapore Airlines charged me a cancellation fee of US$200. I called Singapore Airlines and wrote to ask for the US$200 cancellation fee to be waived and refunded. The experience was a nightmare and the response was shocking to a long time customer. It took a long time to get through the hotline. My request for refund was rejected with no good reason provided.",charged me a cancellation fee of US$200

Singapore Airlines,"My wife and I were travelling to Poland via Singapore and Frankfurt. We had one oversize package, namely a painting rolled and contained in a tube. We were not sure what to do with it as it was very light but more than a meter long. The staff at the Adelaide airport have done their utmost to help us, they contacted the baggage people, took the tube to them and then dispatched it for us! Amazing. Then on board they welcomed us as if we were long lost friends. Hats off to the crew of Flight. SQ 278 on the 19 Sep.",Hats off to the crew
Singapore Airlines,The flight was very pleasant and the staff was exemplary. They were kind courteous and very helpful. The service was excellent. The staff catered to our every need and I will definitely fly Singapore Airlines again. Our flight was on 12th September 2023 and the slight number was SQ 421. A huge thank you to the chief air hostess and to the crew.,flight was very pleasant
Singapore Airlines,"We were given a flight with Scoot from Bangkok to Singapore, and then with Singapore to Auckland. The flight with Scoot was perfectly acceptable but what was not was that they decided that we must collect our boarding pass in Singapore which might have been OK but they they never told us where to collect them from, so we we spent ages trying to find the location and only just made it to the gate in time. The previous leg from Milan to Hanoi involved a Scoot flight and we received all our passes in Milan. On the flight when meals were served the crew just appeared at the seat with a tray whilst we were dozing and expected us to put out the table. As we had ordered book the cook, the main meal service took a while and we had finished our meal before drinks were offered. Premium economy food was no better than Economy fare and considering the cost of the flight a little more thought could have gone into the meal.",no better than Economy fare
Singapore Airlines,"My wife and I had booked a trip to Europe. We unfortunately had to cancel the day before we were scheduled to leave due to a death in the family. I did not have trip insurance and had obtained the tickets with miles. The miles were not refundable. I called Singapore and after providing medical documentation, they generously credited me my miles back so we can re-book our trip at a later date. To me, this is the sign of a FIRST CLASS organization. They were in their rights not to refund the miles, but they did. I have flown Singapore for years, even if a had to take a second flight to arrive at my destination. I will continue to use Singapore every chance I get. I give them 5 stars for their compassion, consideration and rapid response. Thank you.",consideration and rapid response
Singapore Airlines,"Check-in and boarding in Penang were smooth. The lounge in Penang was quite ordinary but completely adequate. On board, the window seat was very comfortable, though storage was limited. My pre-ordered vegetarian meal hadn't been loaded, so I was given a very bready pizza from Economy class. At Changi the Singapore Business lounge in Terminal 3 was vastly superior to those of most airlines, even when crowded. The process of boarding the A380 was smooth. The seat was comfortable and converted into a good bed, but a little tight around the feet. My vegetarian meal was delicious. The number of toilets in the Business section was limited, and there were Economy-type queues in the morning. The luggage was available quickly. Overall a very good experience.",a very good experience
Singapore Airlines,"At Melbourne airport the check-in was very quick and friendly, and the lounge was pleasant and had a good selection of food and drink. Onboard the cabin crew was welcoming, and the seat on the B777 was very comfortable with adequate storage though the diagonal arrangement for lying flat was awkward. No amenities kit was provided. The quality of the vegetarian meals was way above that of other airlines. The flight arrived in Singapore a little early and transfer to a nearby gate for the second leg to Japan leaving in 70 minutes was easy. The boarding process was efficient, and the crew on the B787 were also welcoming and the seat was comfortable (not diagonal for sleeping), though storage space was more limited. The flight arrived on time and luggage was available quickly. All in all a very pleasant journey.",a very pleasant journey
Singapore Airlines,"I cannot speak highly enough of the superlative service received on this flight. After I lost one earbud deep down into my seat the crew were determined to retrieve it for me - the lovely hostess thrust her wrist into the seat workings and fished out my earbud, sustaining some pain and minor abrasion. Unbelievable devotion to service! Every other aspect of the crew's service was impeccable as well. I can wholeheartedly recommend Singapore Airlines - I have just flown Economy Class from London to Singapore and the service was fabulous on that flight as well. I am writing this review on in-flight wi-fi - seems to be working fine, for the first time in my experience.",Unbelievable devotion to service!
Singapore Airlines,"I have just flown SQ256 from Brisbane to Singapore and the experience was second to none with outstanding cabin crew. Well done SQ,",experience was second to none
Singapore Airlines,"SQ227 in Economy. Booked in April. Fare was Starting at $1600.00USD, luckily I was able to use my mileage for this trip. Gate opened right on time, with Cabin Crew going through Security after me. I boarded last, and was welcomed aboard. Crew made comments on my Attaché, saying You look like 007, and other nice touches. One asked I like that! Is that A Rimowa? Nice to see SQ crew attentive, with small touches. Cabin jammed, Had to go around to get to my seat. I sat 62G, and had no Overhead Bin. So I had to use another one. Throughout the flight nobody disturbed my stuff. Luckily my Attaché fit under the seat. Also there is only 1 Lavatory in the rear of the Aircraft. We got served a lovely dinner. I noticed one of the Female crew members, was in a Suit. Flying with SQ since 2008, had me pondered. After the meal I engaged her in some conversation. She said I am a Flight Auditor. Do you have any Feedback Sir?'. I didn't tell her about the appallingly horrific SQ check in at FRA, but maybe I should have. I settled in to sleep. One of the Cabin Attendants asked me if I wanted an aid to cover my eyes, but I said no, and I flew asleep. Woke up 90 minutes out, and was served refreshment. Multiple coffee rounds commenced, with crew approaching sleeping passengers for Refreshment. Landed MEL, with announcements on Luggage coming out late, however no SQ Ground Staff at the Luggage Carousel. If I go to Australia again, I would definitely fly Singapore Airlines.",served a lovely dinner
Singapore Airlines,"World's Longest Commercial Flight, in Premium Economy Solo Seat. Bought Tickets in April. SQ Counter at EWR rather late to open, however incoming aircraft arrived late. Staff didn't know final destination, and I had to help them. No bother, as they appreciated it, and checked my Rimowa through. Cabin Crew arrived 40 minutes before boarding time. Ground staff again were novice, and boarding was kind of rough due to misplaced announcements. I was the last to board. Upon boarding was greeted throughout my walk to my seat. One Attendant even asked where I was going, smiled, and got out of the way. SQ Premium Economy Solo Seat so comfortable, and side bin holds so much. Took off on time, to a lovely sunny day. Had to use the Lavatory, and had to wait, because a Cabin Attendant was cleaning it. She noticed me, and expedited her clean. On IFE the Old is Gold section is gone, but a excess of Old movies were available, and I watched Star Wars. A drink run commenced, then Lunch. When they arrived for Lunch, the Attendant Instantly apologized, and said they only had 1 meal type however, however promised multiple options later. So I went ahead, and had it. Was tasty, followed my Ice Cream, and another drink round. I dozed off, and woke up over Denmark. Went to use the Lavatory again, however it was again being cleaned. Snack/drink runs were conducted. Really appreciate the crew on the details. Had the second meal of Iraq/Iran. I had the Seafood option. Was exceptional, hot too symphony of flavors. More drink runs followed. I dozed off again, and woke up with a Made in Italy pocket Pizza next to me. Landed SIN, to a beautiful evening. Once again SQ21, SQ23 Exceptionally shine.",Exceptionally shine
Singapore Airlines,"I have always had a good cabin experience with Singapore and been a Gold Member for decades. However a recent baggage issue has left me gobsmacked by their tardiness and callous behaviour. Landed in SIN on a stopover and noticed my Delsey case (only 12kg total check in) had a 6 inch case fracture. I reported it and received a case number. On arriving into Cairns the next day, there was no customer service representative visible so I could not pursue the matter. After calling SQ in Singapore after 3 weeks I was finally emailed by a local representative who saw the bag damage photos and offered 100 dollars full settlement for a new bag worth 400 dollars.  The experience has let me reconsider any future SQ travel plans.",offered 100 dollars full settlement
Singapore Airlines,"We had a wonderful crew, especially Singapore to Zurich SQ346 17/7/23 with Marissa, Celeste, Joanne and Scarlet who looked after us wonderfully. They attended to all our needs with no fuss. Thankyou.",We had a wonderful crew
Singapore Airlines,"The service was excellent. Very impressed to see Singapore Airlines continuing to be one of my favourite airlines to travel with. The meals were excellent, inflight entertainment was excellent, and the cleanliness in the washrooms were perfect on both of my flights. It is always wonderful travelling with Singapore Airlines and will always continue to use the airline for future travels! Way to go Singapore Airlines!",The service was excellent
Singapore Airlines,Singapore Airlines still has not reimbursed me for my lost bags back in early January. After fighting them for months they finally agreed to give me some money for losing my stuff. They approved it back on May 18th. They said please allow a month for final approval. Here it is July 17th and still nothing. Singapore Airlines has by far the worst customer service I have ever seen. Please do not fly Singapore Airlines.,by far the worst customer service
Singapore Airlines,"I was looking forward very much to the experience on Singapore Airlines, and even more so, the A380. I was in the bulkhead seat in Premium Economy, so the very first row on the lower level. It was a nice smooth flight, The IFE was adequate, But I was a little disappointed with the level of service. I've always heard about how attentive The Singapore Girl (ie.flight attendants on SQ) were The service was far from the worst I have ever had on an airline, but not as good as I anticipated. Maybe I was comparing it to the absolute best service I have ever had on an airline I flew on my last overseas flight, a Taipei-based airline. Don't get me wrong, It was not bad at all - just not as good I was expecting.",not as good I was expecting
Singapore Airlines,"We had this unpleasant experience while flying with Singapore Airline SQ 622 on July 9th, 2023 at 13:55 from SIN to KIX airport. One of the staff at the plane door who supposed to help my wife to cover the baby stroller with a plastic bag refused to do the job with ours and ask my wife to do it by herself. We saw him covered other's baby stroller with a plastic bag in front of our eyes but refused to do the same thing with ours. This is unacceptable and very rude.",ask my wife to do it by herself
Singapore Airlines,"My first time on a Singapore Airlines flight and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the gluten free meals offered, the variety of inflight entertainment, the excellence of service, the continuous cleanliness of the toilets and just the overall ease of boarding, flying and of course the airport!",I was pleasantly surprised
Singapore Airlines,"We did not receive much assistance on the Noi Bai side, but it was good on the Changi side on arrival. The Song Hong Lounge was decent, with good food and nice view of the apron. Singapore Airlines used an A350-900 for a 3-hour flight, which was amazing. Our book-the-cook meals were decent, though not as good as I would like. In-flight service was excellent.",In-flight service was excellent
Singapore Airlines,"The Silver Kris Lounge at SIN T3 was big and nice. However, finding good seating during peak time was still challenging. The lounge offered good selection of food including Western, Chinese and local options. The flight was on SQ regional A350-900, which has similar flatbed seats as other premium airlines' long-haul equipment. That was really nice for a sub 2-hour flight. In-flight food service was very nice for such a short flight.",really nice for a sub 2-hour flight
Singapore Airlines,"When booking my flight I advised the travel agent I am a coeliac so need a gluten free diet, but I also have allergies to dairy and egg, so needed a GF Vegan meal, thinking this would be the easier option. When I boarded the flight was advised I could have either the GF meal or the Vegan. As the GF had dairy in it was not suitable, and the Vegan has gluten in. They advised me to contact the staff at the airline when I arrived to organise the return flights.  I had fruit which the lovely cabin crew sourced from business class and a bag of potato chips.  I contacted our travel agent to be informed I was listed for the GF vegan meals. So contacted Singapore airlines, the person I spoke to said it was not acceptable that I needed a combination of the two they only dealt with one allergy per person! I would need a Drs certificate if I had to have it. He then told me to take my own food. Which I ended up doing, but the amount of room available on the plane is minimal and awkward to get to bags when you’re elderly. Again the crew managed to source some fruit for me.",needed a GF Vegan meal
Singapore Airlines,"I find it appalling that SA’s flight attendants allow children seated in Economy to come visit their parents in Business. I didn’t pay in excess of $5000 per ticket to be sharing the aisle with other people and be irritated by the noise produced. I was seated in 17D, the person in question was in A17, his child came at night and they played loud games, I was hearing the child’s talking and laughing through my sleep. I believe that it’s not professional behavior on the part of SA’s FAs and they shouldn’t be allowed to place parents and minors in different classes, let alone let the visitors in, no matter what age. I will not be flying Singapore Airlines any longer unless this problem gets fixed.",not professional behavior on the part of SA’s FAs
Singapore Airlines,"We travelled on Singapore Airlines many years ago in economy class. We travelled this time in business class because of the long flight. The service provided on the latest trip was very good, however we did pre order some food that disappointingly did not arrive but the flight menu options were good. The biggest problem we had was the seating arrangements in business class, the seats were hard and uncomfortable. A weird cover was provided to increase comfort. The problem was no calf support and any way shape or form, this has a big impact on leg comfort. There was a flap thing that came out but onlyto the back of the knee which was so useless. The second problem was there was no tunnel to slide into for a flat sleeping position. Instead of the tunnel there was a shelf that had to be pulled out but this was to the side of the seat. Instead of laying flat which we were supposed to achieve the side shelf meant sleeping at an angle which was so uncomfortable. I do not understand why Singapore Airlines would ever believe that their seating arrangements would provide comfort. Cost is huge for these additional benefits for both comfort and health as older people travelling. The outcome is of course we won’t be travelling business class with Singapore Airlines again which is really sad.",seats were hard and uncomfortable
Singapore Airlines,"Not such a great way to fly. I booked an air ticket and the flight departure timing was brought forward by 7 hours. We had the option to accept, reschedule or cancel to get a refund. I chose the third option but was put thru multiple individuals who do not seem to know what they are doing (each contradicting the other) but eventually, I received an email to say the refund was being processed and it would take 6 weeks. Well, it was the 6th week yesterday and I wrote in to enquire, only to be told they will be processing it now. Today I received another email (a proper refund notice this time) to say it will be another 6 weeks for the refund to come thru.",another 6 weeks for the refund
Singapore Airlines,"The First Suite has a lot of space and a lot of gadgets, and some fellow travelers might be impressed. I was rather disappointed by the outline and design of the suite. The bed is not in the direction of the travel, but across the suite. It is narrow and very hard. If the bed is in the non-sleeping position, then it just hangs at the wall to the next suite like a white chunk of wood. In order to dine from the table one has to turn the chair towards the aisle, or towards the fellow traveller in the opposite suite (which is not very private, when, as in my case, the door does not close properly). On both legs to and from Sydney there were technical issues in the suite: either the door could not be closed properly, or the entertainment system did not work at all, or not properly, the seat belt did not fit into the mattress, etc. To add as well, that Singapore Airlines seems to have cut the quality and diversity of the food and wine on offer. Only the Caviar was nicely presented and met the quality standard of First Class food. (On my way to Singapore I have enjoyed Swiss and their First Class product. For a frequent traveller their product was First Class all over, (only with the exception of the bathroom).",rather disappointed
Singapore Airlines,I flew with SQ to and from Auckland on the A 350 - 6 May and 22 May. Both flights were a very nice experience. All flight crew very pleasant and helpful and an especial thanks to Edward - senior flight crew on the outward bound flight from Auckland to Singapore. He epitomised the high standards the SQ expect from their staff. Seats fairly comfortable but slightly awkward layout in the lie flat mode with foot well at an angle. I ordered book the cook and the meals were delicious apart from the Thai Red curry served on the Auckland Singapore leg which was reminiscent of boarding school stew with no flavour. Toilet cleanliness maintained to a high standard. However on both legs the sleeping pillow smelled sour. I am sure the pillow cases were clean but the actual pillows require regular washing as well. Please bring back the hot towel service .,a very nice experience
Singapore Airlines,"From start to finish, the service, food, and cabin crew provided the very best. There are only 4 first class seats on the 777 and as expected more than enough space to stow belongings and move around the cabin. The cabin crew were attentive without being intrusive. Only two negatives. The toilets are tiny and one almost needs to be a contortionist to get changed into pyjamas and the seats although very wide do not have much padding or recline so are uncomfortable for sitting in for long periods of time. In the lie flat mode a good mattress was provided which made the bed comfortable. Food was exceptional and beautifully presented. Only hope that the hot towel service makes a comeback.",provided the very best
Singapore Airlines,Suites on the A380 are in terms of comfort and layout 100% better than on the SQ 777 although the high standard of service remains the same for both aircraft. Lovely welcome from the staff and the cabin crew are exceptionally well presented in grooming and demeanour.  I also am appreciative that I was addressed by my title and surname as I am of that older generation that appreciates such niceties. The suite very comfortable and lovely to have a seperate bed. The two bathrooms are spacious with many amenities and the food glorious. A very special thank you to senior flight crew Tasha (from Indonesia) who was so friendly and epitomised all that is excellent with SQ and also to Kelvin whom I think was the flight manager.,The suite very comfortable
Singapore Airlines,"The A380 layout is nice in appearance, but I have never experienced a business class seat that requires you to lay at an angle in order to use the footrest space. The seats were the hardest I have ever encountered in business class & very uncomfortable. My seat on my outbound or return flights operated properly and I had to call for flight attendant assistance numerous times when the seat buttons simply failed to work. No amenity kits were provided, which was a 1st for any business class flight I have experienced. You had to request eye shades, ear plugs or slippers, with razors, combs, toothbrushes etc. available in the restrooms. It was a significant time after boarding before any drinks were served but it was only juice or water & no champagne was offered. Food in both directions were mediocre at best. Wine offerings were insulting, flight attendants pour no more than 2 into the small glasses, since that was the serving in the 3 requests we made. The Cabin Staff were polite, courteous & professional, but not nearly as service oriented as Qatar or many other 5-Star airlines. We found it quite telling that SG used the Air India Lounge for their business class passengers at JFK, even though Air India is regularly rated as 1 of the lowest quality airlines Worldwide. At least at FRA they used Air Canada's Lounge which was a major improvement, but there was zero preference for business class passengers at FRA boarding. Overall, we found them to be totally disappointing and it failed to deliver the same quality business class service I have had on many other carriers.",totally disappointing
Singapore Airlines,"Very slow and poor customer service from Singapore airlines. I flew from Johannesburg to Bangkok on 20/05/2023. Upon arrival, I noticed my luggage was damaged (the bottom of my bag was broken and the wheel broke off). I contacted Singapore airlines for assistance. they replied with several different emails requesting documentation and pictures which I sent. I am flying back to Johannesburg tomorrow (29/05/2023) without a bag I can use. I've indicated the urgency to Singapore airlines but theres no regard for this.",my luggage was damaged
Singapore Airlines,"Left 2.5 hours late and we almost missed our Singapore Airlines connecting Flight as the Skyrail between terminals was not working and we had 25 mins to get from terminal 1 to Terminal 3. When we arrived at the gate we were told to go to, By Singapore Airlines Sign as we Departed our flight. The gate was shut. We found out by a passerby that the gate changed 2.5 hours previously and was now another 10 mins further on, we made it but our luggage did not. We got on plane to find we were seated separately.  We booked in with staff together & we arrived together. We got to Manchester and were told luggage would be about 4 days. on the 5th day we went to the Airport 2 hours later we emerged hopeful & our baggage arrived on the 6th Day only to find the suitcase with missing roller & damaged. We had to use our own money to buy underware, toiletries, clothes for 2 people & a suitcase. This will be refunded but in the meantime we had to use our own money. I get to the airport to fly out this morning & there is no register of my Vegetarian meal on departing flight and I did enter it at the same time I did the previous flight.  We lost 1/3 of our holiday 100% due to delays. We were allowed to go to the Business Class lounge on the way out as compensation, I should be grateful for Vegetarian Sausages before I leave & a glass of Wine.  Compensation should have been upgrade to business class. We paid extra Premium Economy as we thought it would be more comfortable and relaxing but couldn't have been worse.",Compensation should have been upgrade
Singapore Airlines,Very poor service from flight attendants. There was no menu and couldn’t understand what the attendants were offering for a meal because of the mask. Food was served few hours into flight. Wine selection was bad. Never saw the flight attendant after the first meal on an 18 hour flight Was woken up 8 hours into flight to ask if I needed lunch Never saw the flight attendant after that. No toiletries provided.,Very poor service
Singapore Airlines,"Always loved Singapore Airlines and flew them in all classes many many times. On this occasion flew them on a night flight from Frankfurt to Singapore. Aircraft got switched from an A350 onto A380 on the day and generally that is a great thing, as always love an A380. However my bulk head seat was not the same/good option as it was on the A350. A380 Business Class bed is rather hard, so not the most comfortable to sleep in. In that regard prefer the A350/777 and the older A380s much more! I ordered a Gluten free meal and unfortunately the dinner main was pretty much inedible. Which is a shame. Breakfast was fine however. Service and crew were excellent as usual.",Service and crew were excellent
Singapore Airlines,"HND-SIN was pretty poor. Cabin staff didn't seem very happy. Virtually had a bread roll thrown at me. Meal (only one on a 7-hour flight!) was not hot enough - cold in places - and tasteless. Bag drop at HND was a disgrace - the 'online check in' queue moved faster than the other one - with only two desks open it took 40 minutes. There seems to be no benefit or reason to checking in online. The Singapore Airlines app is not very good either. SIN-LHR-SIN were better. Good cabin staff and service, and the food was hotter and better. Bag drop at LHR was smooth. Boarding well organized and smooth. The pilot explained a 'touch and go' landing at LHR well and there was no panic, but it did mean we were 20 minutes late - and we were already a little behind schedule. Singapore airport is a pain as every gate as its own security check, which took quite a long time on the outward trip. I prefer airports where no further checks are needed for transit passengers. SIN-HND was better and the meals were quite good, as was the service. Plane was old, though. Booked the tickets eight months in advance, and they were never cheaper, yet they were only reasonable. Wi-Fi is only available if you register your Kris Flyer number before you board, which I couldn't because I'd already registered by ANA Mileage number. Why have this restriction?",Cabin staff didn't seem very happy
Singapore Airlines,"We used this airline recently for our trip to India and will not recommend this airline . Both ground service and cabin crew service not very friendly neither very welcoming. For a 16 hour straight flight you get two full meals and the snacks are just some nuts. No sandwiches are offered unless you ask for it. Meal services are also different, kids are not served first always.(sometimes yes they do). Meals also has no varieties like others  like no fruits or yogurt. We were very excited when we got the tickets as it was our first time using this airline but will not use in the future.",not recommend this airline
Singapore Airlines,What has happened to SQ. I believe since COVID they have embarked on a wide ranging cost cutting exercise focusing on charging as much as they can for flights while skimping on what they offer customers. It starts with the lounge which resembles a crowded bus station where you need to search for a seat. Bring back the old lounges! On the flights there are no hot towels. No newspapers. No nuts before dinner. No amenity kits. No mattresses.  Food is mediocre. The only thing that hasn’t changed is the first class cabin crew. I have been a flyer with SQ for over 25 years and have never known it so bad.,wide ranging cost cutting exercise
Singapore Airlines,"It's been a long while since I've flown Singapore Airlines, and they've consistently received accolades for their service, even in Economy Class. However, I was extremely disappointed with their service, especially the catering on board a 7hr flight from Brisbane to Singapore. The aircraft was a new A350, and I had a nice bulkhead seat which allowed me to stretch out. The inflight entertainment was quite good, and the redeeming factor for this flight. Unfortunately, the service and staff was mediocre, and not warm or approachable as I remembered. The food was just awful, especially for a medium haul flight, which consisted of meat and veggies just piled on top of gooey rice. Not even a salad or appetiser (which they used to serve), and a cold bun (there was an ice cream dessert). The washroom was filthy, wet and sticky floor, toilet paper in the sink, even just after the first hour or so, and clearly the crew did not pay much attention to cabin cleanliness (unlike other airlines, where I've seen crew inspect the facilities and do a bit of cleaning). Check in and baggage delivery was fine at the airport (but this may be as I have priority status). But overall, very disappointed with how the quality of service of a reputable airline has declined so much.",the service and staff was mediocre
Singapore Airlines,"SQ38 SIN-LAX on May 9th on a 359. This is the longest leg of return trip from SE Asia with Hubby. The flight is full, mostly with couples and single travelers. In Singapore there is another security check at the waiting room gate, and most travelers didn't realize they have to go through it to go to the waiting room. Many of the these are the infrequent or first time travelers who don't know that they have to scan their electronics and take off their belts jackets and caps off again, making a long line that moved very slow. Boarding was done by zone and was quite orderly, however there was still a line of latecomers going through the waiting room gate check when the boarding begins. This makes the flight have to leave 25 minutes later than scheduled. The FAs were all wearing masks as per their company's precaution and safety awareness policy. However they were all still very friendly, personable, helpful, courteous and polite, and dedicated in giving their best service. The service started as soon as we reached cruising altitude, started with a drink service then dinner, and a second drink service after that. Many of the travelers are Indians so the FAs quickly ran out of the vegetarian meal option that my Hubby was interested in and he had to settle for chicken with pasta, which is very good. After dinner the lights were turned off so people can sleep, but we were told that snacks is available in between the dinner and lunch that will be served 2 hours prior to landing. The cockpit crew communicated well, explaining about the flight plan before we leave and updating us of LAX condition before our descent. They were very good in identifying possible turbulence ahead so we always get notifications to fasten our seat belts before it hits. Restrooms were always kept clean and the FA frequently refresh them with deodorizer. The entertainment system is amazing and full of latest movies as usual, and it's hard to pick and choose what you want to watch next. As with our previous SQ flight, this aircraft has large 11 touchscreen with a USB A that works, and the headphone plug requires two prongs, however it still works well with my wireless headphone adapter which only has one plug. The seat slides forward as you recline so it is a better position to get some rest in a semi reclining position. The lights were turned on just before drink service and lunch was served, and the FAs worked hard to serve us and get everything done before we start our descent into LAX. We arrived at LAX 1 hour ahead of schedule thanks to the strong tailwind. During a bathroom break I casually mentioned to one of the FAs that the day before was my birthday and this trip is to celebrate both our birthdays and our 10 years anniversary. After lunch suddenly we were given two cakes with two glasses of champagne with a happy anniversary written on the plate, and a card from the crew! Wow, I didn't see that coming! Shout out to all SQ38 crews on May 9th 2023! Thank you for your kindness and gifts!","helpful, courteous and polite"
Singapore Airlines,"SQ937 DPS-SIN on 05/09/23 as first leg of return trip from SE Asia with Hubby. The flight used a 78X and it was full of vacationers mostly families, and many of them may have not traveled by air before so it takes time to line everybody up for boarding. Boarding was done by zones and it was a good thing that boarding time was an hour before departure time, because ground staff had to weed out people lining up not in their boarding zone. The flight attendants were as usual with SQ, very nice courteous and polite, and very helpful even with the most clueless passengers. Soon we were all seated and left just 15 minutes behind. Service started as soon as the plane level off, and the FAs were very efficient yet friendly and communicative. One of them even gave us our second round of Singapore Sling without us asking, and we really appreciate him! For a short 2 hours flight the FAs were able to do two beverage service and a meal in between, and that must be quite a challenge for them! The meal offered are using their new sustainability concept, with paper containers and bamboo cutlery so they can be recycled. We found this an excellent proof that SQ is serious in their effort to go green and reducing use of non-biodegradable materials like plastics. The paper container is quite sturdy and even retains good heat for my Nasi Lemak. The portion was a bit smaller but the taste is just the same compared to past ones I had on SQ. The FAs on this SQ flight wears the mask at all times, as part of their company's safety awareness effort. The cockpit crew gave information about the flight plans before we leave and current Singapore condition just before we start our descent, and we arrived just 10 minutes behind schedule. Overall this is another great flight with SQ.",another great flight with SQ
Singapore Airlines,"Despite some allegations of cost-cutting measures surfacing across the internet and social media, Singapore Airlines is still unequivocally and undeniably the best in its class. In an era of self-check in kiosks and self-serve apps, the human touch it provides to all its passengers is remarkably special and the warmth and comfort of the human element is something that is irreplaceable by technology. The cabin crew truly went above and beyond to ensure that the passengers were well looked after. In addition to that, every other aspect of the flight from the checking-in process, lounge, boarding arrangements, punctuality, cabin announcements, seat comfort and functionality, meal service, inflight WiFi and timing and baggage delivery was also seamless and flawless. Flying in Singapore Airlines on a premium cabin is truly and quite literally a heavenly experience at 40,000ft in the sky.",cabin crew truly went above and beyond
Singapore Airlines,"This was a very bad experience, as the service quality of Singapore Airlines has noticeably declined. I couldn't understand why the flight was delayed for 40 minutes due to late passengers. While Singapore Airlines uses environmentally friendly cutlery on its short-haul flights the quantity of food served has been reduced. The unbearable thing for me was that I am a Gold member of Star Alliance, but on arrival to Denpasar I had to wait for 50 minutes for the priority baggage of this flight. The plane arrived at the gate at 21:07, but it was already 22:00 when I got my luggage. Finally, although the entertainment system interface was very nice, there were not many good movies and music options for me.",50 minutes for the priority baggage
Singapore Airlines,"Flight I had with Singapore Airlines are late by up to 90 mins on arrival.  It’s inferior to Qatar Airways business class : underwhelming lounges, okay onboard catering, no dining-on-demand, quirky flat-bed seats (on the A350ULR and more so on the new A380), meager amenities onboard. The cabin crew is somewhat the only part of Singapore Airlines nearly on par with Qatar Airways.",late by up to 90 mins
Singapore Airlines,"22 April flight from SG to Seattle. In all my experience flying with Singapore Airlines, this was the first time I saw more stewards than stewardesses on board. While the cabin crew service was excellent as usual, I would like to give a special shout out and thanks to Cheryl, Jessica and Crystal for their top notch service that is befitting of the Singapore Girl name. On the contrary, the inflight meal was a disappointment. From the menu selection and food quality to the presentation, they are not fit to be served on board an airline as prestigious as Singapore Airlines. The pandemic is over. It's time to revitalise the quality of your inflight meals.",revitalise the quality of inflight meals
Singapore Airlines,"Used Singapore Airlines in economy from Bali to Bangkok via SIN, check in was done quickly using my FF status, security and passport control took around 30 minutes. I used the premier lounge which is okay for a coffee, boarding from gate 4A was organised, I had seat 58A which is an exit row so pretty comfortable, departed on time for the 2 hour 20 minute flight. Once in the air lunch served which is the regional boxed meal, I think it's a great idea for short flights, food was good served by a really great crew. Arrived SIN little bit early I had to transfer from T3 to T2 which is no problem even had time to visit the Krisflyer Gold Lounge for a coffee and be at the gate for my connection. Boarding quickly done and departed on time I found seat 56A fine, again a boxed regional meal served by a proactive crew on this 2 hour flight. Arrived just about on time, bags delivered quickly I was out in the taxi queue within 30 minutes.",a really great crew
Singapore Airlines,"This airline is worth the money every time we have flown with them. The staff always moving around the cabin when it is semi dark as some people are not asleep, offering drinks or snacks to keep up the enjoyment of flying. The food from Brisbane is a big improvement from June 2022 but the food on the return Singapore to Brisbane was a let down with cold and tough beef and two rude female cabin staff but otherwise great service on all flights. We had to fly Emirates Airline from Mumbai to Johannesburg and this airline needs to look how Singapore Business Class is five star.",This airline is worth the money
Singapore Airlines,"Used Singapore Airlines between Cape Town & Bali, check in at CPT very quick and polite as was security and immigration. SQ use the Bidvest lounge which was fine with decent food and seating, boarding was covered quickly so soon at my seat 12A. Once onboard drinks served before departing on time. This flight makes a short stop in Johannesburg where passengers remain on the aircraft, a small lunch served on the first leg by a nice crew. With a new crew departed JNB on time for the 10 hour flight to Singapore, food lunch/breakfast and service during the flight very good as was the seat and TV Options. Arrival in Singapore a little early after a pretty bumpy flight, transfer was fine using the Silverkris lounge in T3 for a coffee and shower before boarding the flight to Bali this time on a 787-10 my favorite SQ Aircraft. Departed a little late for this 2hour 20 minutes flight, crew very nice as was the food, bags delivered to the belt quickly all in all a great trip. I believe SQ are still up with the best. I guess the only thing missing is that amenity kit.",SQ are still up with the best
Singapore Airlines,"MXP-SIN and return. First time for me with SIA, in a very long flight in Premium. Very positive the attitude of the whole cabin crew: very kind, professional and available to satisfy passenger requests. Food and drink were the same than economy, besides they supplied sleeping masks and socks for the night flight only after we requested them. Poor IFE, and annoying loud music during the whole descent and until arrival at the finger. All in all very good crew, but I suspect that in these last years they lost something regarding the quality they were famous for.",very good crew
Singapore Airlines,"My flight started on March 18 KUL-FRA and we were asked to check in our Baby stroller at the gate and we will get it in Germany. The food was not same as before and the quality is pretty bad. Upon arrival we were informed that our stroller did not make the flight and it was delay for 3 days. Worse part when the stroller was return it was damaged. On our return flight April 15 FRA - KUL We found out that our original seats which was bassinet seats were changed and we had to go to the airport early to make sure that my baby has a bassinet. This was very frustrating for us with a 1yr old baby. We were also ask to check in at the gate another bag that contains my baby items as it was too big to go into the overhead cabin as per the crew.  Upon check in we were move to the back side on the aircraft not the seats we booked. The food was not good as well and too far in between for a 12hr flight, the crew was helpful but not regularly offering drinks /snacks not sure if that is the new standard. Meals was served less than 1hr before landing and the crew was rushing the meals. Upon arrival at Singapore a delay on our bags, so we had to wait and check at the airport longer just to get some clarification. They didn't know where our bags are and just informed us that it will be delivered home. Once my baggage was delivered, my luggage was damaged and unusable wheels caved in and the fragile sticker gone.",The food was not good
Singapore Airlines,"Our flights were all delayed and the transfers at Changi Airport were not smooth. Going flight on 14 April 2023 SQ929 SUB-SIN, the departure from Surabaya was delayed. When arrived in Changi Airport, we could not get on our flight to Haneda, and our flights were changed to Narita. The airport change caused longer travel time (from Haneda to home is less than 1 hour but from Narita is more than 2 hours) and cost (from Haneda is about 500 yen but from Narita is about 4500 yen). Return flight on 16 April 2023, SQ631 HND-SIN flight arrival to Changi Airport was delayed. While we could make it to connection flight to Surabaya, our luggage could not. We were disappointed with Singapore Airlines.",We were disappointed
Singapore Airlines,"Star Alliance lounge in Paris rather mediocre, crowded, upper level closed for no apparent reason. Flight uneventful, with comfy seat, good service, stable Wi-Fi and decent entertainment. Food quality and presentation rather poor.  Transit in SG uneventful with crowded lounge with average food offerings. The food on the short sector to BKK was so much better than the flight from Paris to Singapore.","comfy seat, good service"
Singapore Airlines,"We took SQ285 SIN/AKL on 6/3/23 and SQ282 AKL/SIN on 19/3/23 The service has dropped in comparison to our past experience on SIA. The world class hospitality as the latest TV advertisement claims is sadly missing. The warmth, friendliness, cheerfulness, the unique character and personality of Singapore Airlines was not there. There were no disposable wet wipes provided when we boarded the plane. The first meal took fairly long before it was served. Between meals, crew would be walking up and down the aisle with water, drinks and snacks but I did not see this. On our return flight on SQ282, the crew did offer a few rounds of orange juice and water but no snacks. They did not offer toiletries pack. Whether I would recommend this airline, depends on the price point at the time of booking in comparison to other airlines out there. The whole experience felt like a very regular, no fuss airline experience.",did not offer toiletries pack
Singapore Airlines,"There were no manned counters available for economy class at all. Even 2.5 hours before the flight, no staff were available to assist us and staff in Perth airport were not familiar with the self check in kiosk issues. We took a good 2 hours to resolve our check in issues as there was a long line of people waiting in line as all of us had issues checking in via the online kiosks. There were only 2 staff walking around who arrived only 2 hours before flight. We were juggling the queue, our toddler, baggage and when we finally printed our boarding pass, we had to lug everything and our toddler who was cranky at this point from all the waiting and standing and queueing and then self check in our baggage one at a time. It was the worst service ever. Also the captain announced that there will be no wifi for that flight.",no manned counters available for economy class
Singapore Airlines,"The usual pleasant experience at Changi airport with a decent lounge and swift security clearance. The flight was uneventful, quiet with good food, seat, entertainment and service. Even the Wi-Fi was reasonably fast and stable. Overall highly recommended.",usual pleasant experience at Changi
Singapore Airlines,"I want to congratulate the crew for all the attention and service given to us ( My wife and myself). I even asked for their names. They are Wah Lian, Jeffrey, Vivian, Ying, Gloria and Sofia. Please convey our best wishes to them. I have always flown Singapore Airlines and always will in the near future",I want to congratulate the crew
Singapore Airlines,"Good food and great cabin crew. We asked to see the suites, and they let us, after people have left the airplane. Our platypus got some champagne!",Good food and great cabin crew
Singapore Airlines,"Frankfurt to Singapore on Singapore Airlines SQ325, 23 February 2023. 1st drink service served on trays with cups of water or juice & pack of mixed nuts instead of the drink trolley. 1hr+ into a 12hr flight, dinner was served. When it was my turn, I asked for a beer with my dinner but was told there was no more beer onboard explained staff. This flight felt a lot like Scoot.",there was no more beer onboard
Singapore Airlines,"SQ 212 on B777-300 SYD/SIN ; A350-9 SIN/BKK/SIN & SQ 231 on A380 SIN/SYD. First international flight since covid. Two things stand out - as expected, Singapore Airlines were up to their usual high standards with requests, check-in, seating and efficient, friendly cabin service. Despite aircraft being full, a polite request for preferred seating afforded us seats near bulkheads or in exit rows - making the longer sectors far more pleasant with the extra legroom. Flights departed on time, cabin and toilets kept clean at all times. The 2nd issue of significance was that one of my 2 baggage items was nowhere to be seen upon arrival in BKK. This was at a time when all airlines were ramping up after covid and many were having issues with misplaced, lost or late baggage. In fairness to SQ, the item was oversize and handled separately AND we had a tight connection of only 1 hour in SIN. It was reported to staff and next morning I received an email saying the smallish item had been located. I received a phone call and then another email updating me of the delayed baggage and that it would be delivered to my home 100km from BKK airport by courier - and it DID arrive as promised !. Excellent communication and service. It was apparent the item had missed the connecting flight in Singapore - as evidenced by the rush stickers etc all over the article.. Singapore Airlines - a cut above the others.",up to their usual high standards
Singapore Airlines,"London to Singapore, A350 Excellent plane. Great service. Fantastic IFE, terrible food and small portions. I managed to sleep for half of the flight. Singapore to Manila on Boeing 787 an excellent plane. Great service on this short overnight flight. Fantastic IFE. Food was better than previous flight, but still not great. Singapore Airlines meals aren't as good as they used to be.",Excellent plane. Great service
Singapore Airlines,"Terrible seats. We had no space for our legs due to boxes fixed under the seats in front of us. My girlfriend had these boxes fixed in front of her, leaving her only 60% of space for her feet. Myself had only 70% of normal feet space for economy class.",boxes fixed under the seats
Singapore Airlines,"I have been very satisfied with them. At first I was disappointed because originally the A380-800 was supposed to be used, which is my favorite. The staff was very pleasant and accommodating. The food was excellent and beautifully served on high-quality porcelain. Entertainment is very good and extensive. I rate free Internet access with limited speed very positively. The flight was smooth and we landed on time.",The staff was very pleasant
Singapore Airlines,"We queued for checkin for 30 minutes, staff were very good. A chaotic and slow boarding process at the gate but when we entered the jet bridge it was very calm and welcoming with staff being very attentive and informative. We had a problem with our star alliance flight the night before as it was cancelled so we were reallocated this flight. Singapore Airlines gave us the front economy seat which had more leg room than any other flight. It was on time and meals were served soon after take off meals were good as well as the rest of the flight",very attentive and informative
Singapore Airlines,"Imagine a 14 hour trip being near perfect. Boarding, crew, food, seat, Wi-Fi, drinks, all of it. This cabin crew was amazing and managed to be sincere while also being efficient. They seemed to truly want to deliver the best and they did. 14 hours literally flew by in the lie flat comfy seat. The crew was proactive and seemed available whenever I needed something.",cabin crew was amazing
Singapore Airlines,"A decent experience. Check in was fast and easy, lounge was comfortable with good food offerings. Boarding was slightly chaotic but not awful. The aircraft is wonderful with comfortable seating and leg room. IFE was good. Meal decent for a two hour flight. Had to ask for an amenity kit. Flight was basically on time. Not stellar but better than most. Wifi wasn’t working.",A decent experience
Singapore Airlines,The ground crew were unreasonable and very rude. We were denied boarding as according to them we were 4 minutes late.  The ground crew did a lousy job of offloading our luggage. We had to wait almost half a day in the baggage carousel before filling a missing bag report.,we were 4 minutes late
Singapore Airlines,"Singapore Airlines is by far the best airline I have flown it. The cabin is a spacious 3-3-3 layout in it's Economy Class with excellent mood lighting. The cabins lack individual air vents and can make it uncomfortable sometimes. Food was average and the portions were not great. However, the cabin crew do everything from serving snacks like sandwiches, cup ramen, chips, cookies, etc. to the passengers from time to time with water and beverages. Hospitality was five-star. From the welcome at the door, the crew help out passengers with a smile. Given that they work for hours together on some ultra-long haul flights and with a wide of array of passengers onboard, it is amazing to see them help you with a smile, always. In seat entertainment had a lot of options and can easily entertain any person, young or old, on a 17 hour flight. In all, the experience was great and I would recommend SQ to everyone.",Hospitality was five-star
Singapore Airlines,"Have heard great things about Singapore Airlines, so decided to give it a try. Booked a long haul flight. Even though it's almost 17 hour flight, but didn't feel like one, when my journey ended I was as fresh as when I boarded the flight. Silverkris lounge at Changi Airport was good. They have sleeping pods as well as a bathroom, where you can take a shower, in case you feel like one. Food was amazing. They have the facility called - Book a Cook, which I'd used for getting my Steak. (Attached the pic), it was so delicious and perfect as if I'm dining in a restaurant. Crew were polite and very helpful. Only drawback that I find is - at New York (JFK Airport), they don't have a nice lounge. Lounges, they have partnered with were so small and didn't have a nice quick bite / snacks or drinks. Wish they could do something about it. All in all, must admit, Singapore Airline is the best airline.",Singapore Airline is the best airline
Singapore Airlines,"I miss the pre-pandemic Singapore Airlines. I have flown with them on a regular basis for decades and am disappointed at how bad the first flight I took with them since the pandemic was. My flight was purchased from Air Canada and AC is the first marketing carrier as per US DOT rules. AC is also the most significant carrier. I have clearly researched my baggage allocation prior to the trip and packed appropriately. Unfortunately, the SIA check in staff were clearly unaware of their own company's baggage policy (see pictures below) and refused to allow me to check my three bags. I had to repack my bags at the airport, which is both embarrassing and a complete hassle. I have never had to do this in my decades of leisure and business travel. I will definitely think twice before taking a flight with SIA again in the future.",miss pre-pandemic Singapore Airlines
Singapore Airlines,"Was this a memorable flight? Not really. I like the entertainment selection. The seat was fine for just over a 2 hr flight on SQ177. Actually not much different to the 350-900 medium haul except maybe the adjoining two seats in the middle are closer. The food. Oh my. Dreadful. Sounded great, lemongrass chicken. It was very fatty and unpleasant. The bok choy was almost raw. I would have preferred a plateful of the garlic bread instead of the tiny slice I was given. All in all it was a very average experience. I miss the Singapore Airlines pre Covid and really think they need to up their game in the food area especially. I booked this flight as at the time it was actually cheaper to go to HCMC via Singapore than just to Singapore. However, I wish I booked through Vietnam Airlines and saved money and connection hassles.",a very average experience
Singapore Airlines,"Overall an ok flight. Lounge - SilverKris Changi is huge and was too over crowded. We had to sit at a canteen type table which was uncomfortable. We only stayed long enough to change our sim and change clothes. Way too busy. Gate/Boarding. We got in line. Was told there was no point as it hadn’t opened. We stayed in line as seats get taken in there fast. Boarding passes are scanned after security which meant the one gate agent could not cope when it was boarding time and everyone stormed the gate not adhering to groups or priority. Seat - narrow. Overhead lockers were too high for me to reach even with the little foot aid thing. Others had to help. No other storage except under the foot rest. There is a tiny cubby hole where ear phones, menu and water bottle were kept. Not a comfortable seat to sleep in being so narrow with no wriggle room. Hard being a side sleeper. Food - As all my other flights had poor quality food I opted for no meal, just sleep. The passenger in front argued with the FA over no breakfast service. Personally I believe there should have been a choice but no. The lovely FA verified no meal with me and offered to keep cheesecake aside that she would serve to me with coffee when I woke which was lovely of her. As I woke an hour or so before landing she was right there with what was promised. On arrival luggage arrived quickly so we were one of the first through customs with no long line. Overall the crew really are the highlight with Singapore Airlines. The rest is average to below average with definite cut backs evident. Also disappointed that when I booked this flight it was for the 777 which has better seats for sleep but that changed to the less than comfortable 350-900 medium haul.",crew really are the highlight
Singapore Airlines,"Disappointing flight from Singapore to Auckland. A good seat, tasteless food and the worst Illy coffee i have had. What concerned me the most is the cost we paid for these flights, this one one of four flights we took on Singapore airlines over the last three weeks. The Auckland to Singapore flights seemed understaffed, whereas the Singapore to Bangkok flights seemed a lot more organised and a better food selection.","A good seat, tasteless food"
Singapore Airlines,"The flight seemed quite full with huge line up at the gate security area. No priority line but that’s ok. Boarding was odd with just a gate agent yelling out instructions. The seat was fine but no bottle of water which was disappointing. We used book the cook. My husbands beef cheek was tender but my steak was too tough to cut or even bite into. The crew were lovely but disorganised. The right side of the plane were offered bread after the meal not before. My side missed out entirely. Arriving at Ho Chi Minh city, no priority line for immigration. Never mind. It was a 5/10 flight. Nothing special.",It was a 5/10 flight
Singapore Airlines,"They cancel our flight and push us to an 8h earlier flight, and notify us last minute by calling us internationally about the change. Their customer service put us on hold for more than half of the 25 minute call, something that could have been done online for free, but they found it necessary to call. They even didn't offer food and beverage vouchers to cover the extra 8h on Singapore Airport. Their ground staff was sending us from one side to the other without a solution. After trying to get in touch with them it took 1.5 month to get a reply saying they don't care. Also transfer was unclear as the gates were closed until very close to departure. My inflight food was very bad, and in-flight service almost non-existent. You had to go to the kitchen area to ask for some drinks. In-flight entertainment was good with many recent movies. I will never fly again with Singapore Airlines after this.",My inflight food was very bad
Singapore Airlines,"Full flight. Check in was busy, business class full. The lounge in Melbourne was okay, bit old and dated but the food was good. Boarding protocol was strictly adhered to. We were warmly welcomed. This medium haul aircraft was far different to the A380 in business. The seats although adequate were so much smaller. I was surprised to see not only a blanket and pillow but slippers, face mask, socks and amenity kit on my seat. The storage bin overhead is very high up and 158cm me needed help to stow my bag. Not much storage at the seat, just under the footstool and a tiny cubby hole once the headphones and water are removed. The staff were very friendly but reactive rather than pro active. They didn’t check the cabin during the flight but would respond to pushing the button for an attendant. The food was okay. Nothing special, steak was tough but the dessert was lovely (cheesecake). Entertainment was pretty good, quite a lot of choice, and the flight map was excellent. The refreshment before landing was not nice, chorizo and pasta. Quantity not quality. We arrived slightly sooner than scheduled. Altogether it was good for a day flight but not sure it will be comfortable enough for an overnight flight.",seats although adequate were so much smaller
Singapore Airlines,What a shame. Delayed baggage when I arrived at the Paris airport. The representative told me that it would be sent the next day. I arrived on Thursday evening and it is now Saturday evening and I have not seen my luggage. Neither received any calls from anyone. I don't know where is my luggage and I am left waiting for it at home. Even low cost airline provide a better customer service support. I have no idea why it is cited as among the best airlines. It is not even Top 20 in my book. Was my first time flying with this airline and it will be the last.,Delayed baggage when I arrived
Singapore Airlines,"(Two separate return journeys, different equipment). Pretty well can't be faulted. E.g. the airline staff went the extra mile in several respects, including luggage which didn't make a tight connection, but which I still got in 24 hours. The A350s are somewhat more comfortable in feel than even the A380s, the IFE on both aircraft is good, though the A350s have a live BBC news feed I can recommend. Would happily fly with them again.",Would happily fly with them again
Singapore Airlines,"SQ171 DAD-SIN. Terrible flight. Boarding started late and was chaos, with no real explanation about the delay. Upon boarding could not use the overhead above my seat, and was not allowed to have any personal items. There was a Headphone shortage. Took off, and inflight service started rather late. Cabin attendants speaking extremely fast, and I was unable to comprehend what they were saying. Multiple times, Had to ask them to slow down. They ran out of food. Offered Entrée was disgusting, and I refused. They came back, and tried to offer me the Business Class entrée, but there was only 1 choice. I passed, but they hounded me with endless questions. Landed, and couldn’t get access to my luggage. Singapore Airlines is only good on Ultra Long Haul flights. With Asian connections not anymore, since they got rid of the A330.",offer me the Business Class entrée
Singapore Airlines,"Boarding was prompt and the flight landed early. Very hard-working cabin crew. They tried their best to fulfil requests. They were less proactive with coming around with drinks during the flight compared to my previous flights, but responded to individual requests made to them directly. The aircraft was very clean but cupholder on my seat was broken. Overall I feel comfortable flying with this airline and would choose to do so again, knowing I will get a certain standard of service.",hard-working cabin crew
Singapore Airlines,"My first flight post-pandemic and Singapore Airlines lived up to high expectations. The cabin crew were excellent and made regular drinks runs throughout the flight with trays of water, juice and sometimes beer. I was impressed by their professionalism, politeness and friendliness throughout the journey, despite having to serve almost a full flight. Flood (including snacks in between meals at the galley) was plentiful, even for economy class. Two free hours of wifi for economy class passengers was a welcome addition to the service. Everything went smoothly, from boarding to disembarking. Prior to the flight I had called the call centre to make a booking amendment and the service from the call centre was also efficient.",lived up to high expectations
Singapore Airlines,"Singapore Airlines ranged from excellent to good. Syd-Sin-Cph (Oct 6, 2022) was excellent. Of course in Economy we were packed like sardines, but the tin was large enough (and neighbours small enough) that we weren't particularly uncomfortable. This is the third time we've flown post-Covid. The first time on Thai it seemed that Covid was the excuse to give no service at all but Singapore Airlines both at Xmas 2021 and last month provides excellent service. Food was very good and alcohol plentiful. The entertainment system provided enough to occupy us for this long haul. Flight attendants were very attentive. We stopped over in Singapore on our way home. Unfortunately Sin-Syd leaves shortly after midnight. The flight was delayed and it was after 1am before we left. This is a long time between meals and we were uncertain whether we'd be given a snack and night cap before going to sleep but no announcement was made and we stayed in limbo between sleeping and waking for most of this leg. Of the four legs of our journey this is our only complaint.",provides excellent service
Singapore Airlines,"SQ23 in Premium Economy Solo Seat.  1730 Arrived at The counter. Instantly was approached, and greeted by a extremely professional gentleman, Asking which flight I was on. When I told him SQ23, he asked “could you please wait?”. Well I went to get water, came back, and instantly he reengaged me, stating the counter was ready for me, and took me straight to the head of the line. Check in fast, with agent verifying information. Boarding was quick. Upon boarding a Red Uniformed Cabin Attendant welcomed me aboard, and directed me to my seat. As I passed others they acknowledged me and welcomed me aboard. One even said “Happy Thanksgiving”. Aircraft seemed extremely cold, and rather uncomfortable. We seemed to be late pushing back, and The Red Uniformed staff was going around talking to passengers. She approached me, and began to engage in conversation. She thanked me for flying SQ for 14 years. Finally we Took off. I had to use the provided blanket. Champagne is back on the menu. When they arrived with Dinner, they ran out of food, so the Steward said he had to go to Business to get entrees. He came back and said what he had. I ordered the Beef. He kept checking in, with estimated time of completion. Constant Champagne rounds followed through the flight. After dinner I slept. Standalone seat extremely comfortable, and excellent value. Second meal came out. I had the Stir Fry Shrimp which was Delicious. Constant Champagne refills continued. On approach to Changi, I switched to Coffee, which also continued with multiple rounds. Arriving in SIN on Thanksgiving morning, crew wished us well as we debarked. I have been flying with Singapore Airlines since 2008. This flight maybe the best experience I have ever had with them!!!",maybe the best experience
Singapore Airlines,"I'm a vegetarian, the food was tasty but I have some thoughts: a bun served with butter without any addition in one of the main meals? I had to ask for a drink because the service  walked by multiple times ignoring me. I flew with them 4 times, two flights of 14.5 hours plus 2 shorter flights on 1 out of 4 flights, I can say that the service was at a high level. The seats were super uncomfortable. The number of drinks served for 14.5 hours is really poor. The last drink I asked for was water, and the staff brought me a tap water.",seats were super uncomfortable
Singapore Airlines,"Late evening check in was surprisingly busy, but with all counters open there was not much delay. Similarly the lounge was busy. There was a decent selection of food, but the wine on offer was disappointing. Boarding was prompt with a friendly welcome, and champagne and fruit juice on offer before take off. Drinks were served immediately after take off, and it seemed that most passengers opted for sleep rather than food. The seats are very comfortable for sitting and relaxing, but in the lie flat position the recess for the feet is restricting. There were four breakfast type food options available, to be served immediately or before landing, which made a lot of sense, but the Continental breakfast was very basic and disappointing. Brisbane airport was very quiet early morning, and immigration and luggage delivery very quick. Overall it was a good flight, and the cabin crew were excellent, as expected on Singapore Airlines.",the cabin crew were excellent
Singapore Airlines,"I wanted to change my flight ticket on 20th of April and was rushed to send a confirmation for a flight change before 21st April which involved a payment of 300 SGD which I agreed to. Upon calling back a few days later after checking that my flight has not been booked over the website, the agent over the phone tried to salvage the situation by insisting that my original flight change booking flight was cancelled and instead, I now would have to pay SGD 1700 to rebook the flight change. There was no such cancellation of flights as the flight number of the cancelled flight was the exact same flight as the one that he proposed. I tried calling on multiple occasions and even though Singapore Airlines admitted their fault for messing up my booking, they would not change my flight at the original price that was agreed upon. As a result, I had to miss my other travel plans to London.  My main issues are these: 1) After rushing me to confirm the flight changes before 21st April, which I did on 20th April, why was the flight not booked at the original agreed price of SGD 300. Is it a lack of competence that your staff can't operate a computer?",pay SGD 1700 to rebook the flight change
Singapore Airlines,I ordered Muslim Meals and received Chicken curry for breakfast lunch and dinner. Seriously chicken curry for breakfast? About 20 years ago I wrote to Singapore Airlines about the same issue. Take note Muslim diets are much broader than chicken curry.,chicken curry for breakfast?
Singapore Airlines,I have no words for the hospitality the Singapore Airlines staff on the flight has shown me I have taken more then 20 flights this year but undoubtedly this airline is the best. I will surely and only try to fly Singapore. I am just amazed by the love and care they showed to my 7 year old from Mumbai to Sydney and coming back to India from Sydney. Thank you so much.,I have no words for the hospitality
Singapore Airlines,"We flew the SQ 322 flight from Singapore to London Heathrow on Tuesday 2nd august 2022 arriving at London Heathrow at 6am. When we got on the flight the seat part of my daughters seat was missing. She was seated in 54k next to the window. Somebody came and replaced it so she could sit down. We all fell asleep immediately as it was almost 1am in the morning Sydney time. Half way through the flight my daughter realised her socks were wet. We had a look at them and realised they stank of vomit. We then checked all of her toys and our bags that were on the floor and they were all damp and stank of vomit. All of her things, shoes, socks and bottom of her trousers just absolutely stank of vomit and the ground was soaking wet. I can not believe that after such a terrible pandemic my daughter was allowed to sit in an area where someone had so obviously recently been vomiting. Not to mention how disgusting it has been travelling to our hotel in a car with bags all covered in sick and smelling absolutely terrible. I complained to the air steward and asked her to make a note as it was such a disgusting way to have to sit on a long haul flight. Our short UK holiday absolutely ruined, not being able to see my terminally ill father for 8 days in fear of passing it to him, which his immune system could not have handled. This after not seeing him due to the pandemic for 3 years! I understand we flew economy, but at the very least we expected the seats to be clean and sanitary. I emailed the airline through my husbands official Singapore Airlines account, and we heard nothing. I emailed several times, nothing. I only got a response from the airline when I involved a third party resolver government site that helps consumers. They told me nothing had been reported, and that the airline staff deny this even happened. So at the very least they are not logging and recording the changing of seats which must be a safety issue. I find very hard to believe the air steward doesn't remember covering the vomit floor with a blanket and spraying air freshener over it for us. I also asked her to log it all, and she said she would. The airline said all the attendants had been interviewed but they all deny this even happened. It's not so much what happened, it is more the absolute denial that it even took place.",denial that it even took place
Singapore Airlines,"Check in was quick and efficient as expected with Singapore Airlines. Lounge access was the Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse, which at that time of day seemed to be devoted to SQ passengers. Lounge service was excellent, with a good selection of food and drinks. Boarding was on time and very efficient, with a personalised welcome on board.. settling in was very easy, as there is so much storage available at the seat and above. Pre take off drinks were offered, but only fruit juice and water, no champagne. No amenity kits offered except by request. Food and drink orders were taken immediately after take off, and serve with sosatie appetisers. Meals were served not long after with a varied choice of mains. Book the Cook is not available ex Johannesburg, and also whilst it is possible to preview the menu, it is not possible to order. Not a problem for us, as we were near the front. Decent wines were on offer, although a somewhat limited choice. Food was good, as was the service. The seat is very comfortable and notably wider than most. Flor sleeping it is necessary to fold down the backrest to create the bed, which is easily done, although attendants were quick to help. The drawback to the bed is a small cubbyhole for the feet offset from the bed, although in use this was not a particular problem, and wwe both slept for most of the flight. Breakfast was offered as and when people woke, and arrival in Singapore on time. As usual immigration was a breeze. Our only downside was we found the entertainment system difficult, but this is probably an age thing. Overall a very good flight",Overall a very good flight
Singapore Airlines,"No pillows in economy cabin for a 13hr flight, I was offered an extra blanket to use as a makeshift pillow, hardly comfortable. Meal portions were small, no salad or small starter was offered, no towelette and they don't provide salt and pepper sachets with the meal. WiFi was erratic and terminal 2 is a non event due to renovations ! All in all a highly unsatisfactory experience and we will think twice before flying Singapore Airlines again.",don't provide salt and pepper
Singapore Airlines,"No staff at the transfer desk to issue boarding pass. I was told to proceed to the boarding gate for service. After one hour of waiting in a queue, several people including me were finally get their passes. While we were lining up, many travellers (probably first and business class) cut the queue to insist on going to the aircraft first.  From what I feel, they need a bigger crew to service the A380. Staff avoided eye contact with me to speed up their service. Food was not ready for the first meal. I had to wait half an hour for my main meal after finishing everything else. I was not offered a drink and when I asked, they signalled me to wait. I waited for another half an hour without any drink from the crew yet the guy two rows in front of me asked for a refill and was offered immediately. Second meal was a total disaster, it took an hour for our cabin to be served. To the point that, many people who were already served, they expected their trays to be cleared but nothing happened and many people took the matters into their own hands by bringing trays to cabin crew. Drinks were offered and served very minimally. I can confidently say it because my second flight later with an A350, it was a joy again. Everything ran on time. Polite and civilized boarding. No late service. I still can feel a drop in service as compared to pre-pandemic time.",I was not offered a drink
Singapore Airlines,"Ruined a trip of a lifetime for myself, wife and family. From cancelling our paid seats, that were booked early, we were then separated on the flight. Some of our baggage was left behind, and a absolutely nightmare trying to sort. Staff on plane and at airports not interested and give the feeling that they did not want to be there.",cancelling our paid seats
Singapore Airlines,"Sydney - Amsterdam - Frankfurt -Singapore (stopover) - Sydney. All flights were up to the 'old' SIA standards of service. Check-ins and transfers were easy and the lounges were clean and well-stocked. Meals ordered online and were tasty and well presented with plentiful beer, wines and spirits offered with them and during the flight - possible a little too enthusiastically. The cabin crew were friendly and efficient and made the flights very pleasant indeed. You do need to ask for amenity kits and slippers if you want them and the absence of an offer of hot towels was initially disappointing but a plentiful supply was discovered in the wash rooms for self-serve. The lie-flat beds were made up by the crew if you showed any hesitation in figuring out how they worked and were comfortable once you became used to the idea of sleeping on a bed where the lower half was offset to the upper half. Cabin WiFi worked OK and the IFE seemed to have a reasonable selection, although eating and sleeping were my preferred options on the overnight flights. All in all, SIA seems to be back with their reputation intact.",back with their reputation intact
Singapore Airlines,"Still my favorite airline. Best Economy Class !, spacious seats with nice legroom, pleasing color fabric on seat covers. Each seat had a pillow and a blanket. You should ask to offer you an amenity kit (with socks, eye cover, toothbrush / paste). Pity they do not have inflight magazine due to covid (same excuse to save money and weight, a lot of airlines are using the same excuse). Both flights were on perfect A350 and on time. After takeoff they started the first service which was tasty and there was selection of wine, beer, drinks. After food was desert which was an icecream. During flight the crew was passing by the bottle of water for the passengers. At the galley there were some sandwiches and drinks. In the WC there were toothbrushes, cologne and cream. One hour before landing the second meal was served which was as good and plentiful as the first. IFE was great with a good selection of movies and easy to use. Great airline, keep the good work.",Still my favorite airline
Singapore Airlines,I flew with Singapore Airlines from London on a 11.30am local time arriving in Singapore 7.30am local time next day. For some unknown reason this airline serves breakfast at 1.45am Singapore time. I and other passengers were woken up so we could have a breakfast. Once breakfast was finished we still had 5 more hours of flying time. How stupid is this. Dreading my flight home. I have travelled with this airline in the past but it now is on a par with a low cost airline. Very disappointed.,Very disappointed
Singapore Airlines,"The check-in process at JFK T4 was seamless. We got access to the Wingtips Lounge, which was fine but there was nothing to be excited about. Boarding was orderly despite the fact that there were many passengers (our A380 flight that night was almost full). On board, the seat looks nice and comfortable, though one of the windows is blocked by the seat design. Staff were nice and attentive, something you would expect from SQ anyway. The food was excellent (I booked my main course from the Book-the-Cook menu). The flight arrived in Frankfurt a bit late, but not a problem at all. Overall, this is what a good flight should be.",this is what a good flight should be
Singapore Airlines,"New York JFK check in a disaster, with no control, and only 2 agents open. For an extremely protracted amount of time, I stood in line, and finally got checked in, just before the Station Manager mustered everyone, for the evening brief, pausing check in. Boarding commenced 15 minutes late.  No boarding by rows, just a mass exodus. Upon boarding the Cabin Attendant at the door, was the sole person to welcome me onboard. IFE finally got upgraded, and the A380s fixed shellback seat was extremely comfortable. Upon taking off I dozed off, and was waken up by Cabin Crew to close my window shade. No initial drink offered to me. I requested Chicken for dinner, and the Gentleman said he had to come back. 15 minutes later, I hit the call button, and when the young lady I arrived, I explained to her I did not receive dinner. Finally the Gentleman returned, apologized, and ensured dinner would be out shortly, which it was. Followed by a second round of drinks. Woke up to a refreshment, of extremely small Sandwich of sorts, and a quick round of drinks. Arrived at FRA, and off to my connection. With all my hours, flights, and years flying with Singapore Airlines I will try to brush this off, and hope a repeat of this experience will not happen again.",JFK check in a disaster
Singapore Airlines,"Singapore to Sydney. The decline in service and product continues from Singapore Airlines. Premium Economy includes plastic glasses, only two wine choices (Red or White) only one glass was offered per passenger and the food offering economy standard. Neither of the above are consistent with the airline’s advertised offer. The were no masks/socks offered. The A380 Premium Economy seats are much poorer design compared to the A350 seat in the same class/airline. Hard vinyl covered seats, impossible to get comfortable in. Booked a window seat but impossible to lean against the window as seat is 200mm from window. Unless you can book for only 10-15 % more than economy I wouldn’t bother Entertainment is good in its range but the system is unstable. Wifi wouldn’t connect",decline in service and product
Singapore Airlines,"The staff were most helpful and delightful, especially Joanne, Lilin, Thiagesan and Edward. I can’t say enough for their warm hospitality, and being very friendly and capable in their jobs.",can’t say enough for their warm hospitality
Singapore Airlines,"Short answer: extremely dated and old aircrafts, unpleasant ambiance, cramped seats and broken seats, closed toilets, subpar food. Good attitude of flight attendants. Long answer. The last time I flew SQ was back in 2006 and do remember that it was a very pleasant flight. Since then mostly have been flying Qatar, Emirates, Turkish and many EU/American airlines. First impression, the ambiance of the aircraft is very unpleasant when comparing it to Emirates or Qatar. IFE is small screen with limited choices. No amenity kit of any sort - zero. There was a blanket and a pillow though. One of the toilet from LA to Singapore was closed with an Out of Order note on it, so basically keep waiting for your turn. Food quality is really terrible compared to Emirates/Qatar. No salad or fruit. During the flight no water service. I am used to sitting on 15 hour Dubai flights but never get such pain as this time on Singapore. It is basically now a budget airline but with a 5 star price tag. Even the business class seats look tired and dated. Won't recommend unless you have no choice.",extremely dated and old aircrafts
Singapore Airlines,"I recently flew Singapore Airlines Brisbane to Cape Town, only to have them lose my luggage. Despite contacting the Cape Town, Brisbane and Singapore office I have had no contact from anyone, apart from a generic email, dated 6 days ago saying they are attempting to locate my luggage. What should have been a happy experience has been completely ruined not only losing my luggage, but all the gifts I had bought my family who I haven’t seen in four years.",attempting to locate my luggage
Singapore Airlines,"Great to be flying with Singapore airlines again!  Pre Covid my wife and I had always flown with Singapore airlines and were interested to see whether the high standard of care that we were used to still existed in the post Covid world. The answer is yes. The food was great and its delivery well timed. The entertainment options were excellent with a menu to meet a wide variety of tastes. We were seated in the rear compartment so were able to see the staff at work. The staff we saw were: CS Alvin, LSS Mei, LS Aslam, FSS Chia, FSS Ng, FSS Foo and FSS Chee. They did not stop working for the whole flight yet they were always caring and courteous, going to every length to meet the passengers’ needs. They are great ambassadors for their company. Wherever possible, we would always choose to fly with Singapore",would always choose to fly with Singapore
Singapore Airlines,"SQ033 from San Francisco to Singapore in what was sold a premium economy. Apart from slightly larger seat there is nothing to distinguish from regular economy. Very cramped in 2-4-2 seating. No champagne for take-off on 15-hour journey, no amenities, not even hand cream in the bathroom. In addition the entertainment system was bizarre — if you aren’t a fan of Tom Cruise or superheroes you are out of luck. Seriously, there was nothing to watch. Could not comment on the dinner as we chose to eat in the airport. Breakfast was okay for an economy class meal but coffee was not good. I paid a substantial premium for this and I am not impressed.",I am not impressed
Singapore Airlines,"Queued for Business class check in - only 2 servers. Entertainment very limited, games needs your own device. My meal was very poor. Seats and staff ok. Photo is the 5pm refreshment.",My meal was very poor
Singapore Airlines,"Our first flight was delayed more than one hour, so we lost our connecting flight. The new booking provided was horrible. I was travelling with my four-year-old and the new seat provided is far away, and we were separated. All the family members are separated for the whole journey. Miscommunication between the crew members made us to walk between the terminals for 2 times. Didn't get any help from the crew, even though we requested to provide a seat together.",requested to provide a seat together
Singapore Airlines,"Order special meals from through their apps. In the flight, I was not served with the chosen special meals, and asked the flight attendant to check. She said that all special meals has been handed out.  I had to write a email via the help section to double confirm what's the reason behind this. I was told via email that special meal was not able to be catered on the said flight due to insufficient preparation time. Truly disappointed with these behavior. There is no inflight entertainment for 2.5 hours flight, and the standard inflight meal is small in portion.",all special meals has been handed out
Singapore Airlines,Great flight! I arrived yesterday morning in Amsterdam after an almost 13 hours trip from Singapore with my wife and small son. Flying in the business class of Singapore airlines was an amazing experience. The seat is very convenient. In the night the crew prepares a bed for you which was fine. I ordered before the flight the lobster which was absolutely delicious. The service during the flight was great. The crew was very nice to my son and us. The breakfast was also ok. All in all this was one of the best flight experiences ever for me! Amazing flight and service!,an amazing experience
Singapore Airlines,"When I checked-in online for this flight, there was a premium economy seat that can be selected even if I only bought an economy class ticket. I selected it and I was able to have the seat with no extra charge. I was pleased with the ground handling, service and quality of food. The Laksa was very delicious! The flight was on-time and the in-flight entertainment was top-notch! One thing that was not working is the Wi-Fi as I was only able to use it for a few minutes. I will definitely fly with Singapore Airlines again.",definitely fly with Singapore Airlines again
Singapore Airlines,"My recent flight from London to Singapore was very disappointing. Granted that the departure and arrival times were very good, and my seat was comfortable. Gone are the warms towels prior to your meal, no menu cards and no water runs through the flight. Then there was the lunch service, the bread roll was more like a brick - when asking the flight attendant if I could have another one he replied that they were all like that. No entree /dessert on  meal tray. Breakfast was served 5 hours prior to landing and my meal was very poor in quantity and quality.",meal was very poor in quantity and quality
Singapore Airlines,"Smooth check-in and outstanding service at the airport. The red-eye flight was delayed by 1,5 hour and at the gate SQ organised a buffet where one could get a hot meal, able to choose between vegetarian on with chicken. It was a very nice touch, was really impressed (especially comparing it to what you don't get from other airlines in similar circumstances). After boarding, very welcoming crew and for those still hungry there was the normal meal service with a round of drinks.",outstanding service at the airport
Singapore Airlines,"Nice flights, first leg got Premium Economy seat (but still normal Eco-Service) being SQ Gold. Nice hot meal as per the new concept for short flight with SQ. Long layover in SIN, could visit the new Silverkris Lounge and then onwards on SQ's new 737max. Very comfortable plane, nice interacting crew and lovely dinner served, watching a good movie on their in flight entertainment!",Very comfortable plane
Singapore Airlines,"SQ is one of my favorite airlines, but unfortunately in-cabin experience is less. Still great inflight entertainment (among the best in the industry) but food service is being downgraded.  The round of drinks before dinner/lunch on longer flights, the appetizer on the tray and the hot towel upon boarding are gone. Of course nothing really serious, but with what you pay extra to fly with SQ it is an issue. Check-in process in FRA was efficient (as always with SQ) and the transit in SIN was a little tedious, as Germany (origin of my journey) was Covid-listed again: therefore it was not permitted to walk freely around the airport in January 2022 and I had to wait for my connection in a reserved quarantine area. On the shorter flight to JKT you get now a box with (very) hot food, which is a downgrade compared to what you got before but still is quite ok. On both flights crew was very friendly and interactive.",crew was very friendly and interactive
Singapore Airlines,"Checkin in Istanbul fast and efficient. Turkish Airlines lounge just amazing; something SQ could learn from looking at its „upgraded“ new Krisflyer Lounge in Terminal 3 in Singapore. Boarding in Istanbul was well organized. Seat spacious and comfortable. Food decent, but unfortunately no Book the Cook service ex Istanbul. The big negative point of this flight was the service. Painfully slow, but still hectic and robotic. The lunch service took almost 3 hours. It took an hour from the Satay serving till the appetizer was served. No dining on demand like the ME carrier. Out of the 10.5h flight, almost half of the time was spent with meals. What happened to the previously famous Singapore girl? SQ service does not have the perfection of Qatar, nor the efficiency of LH. Krisflyer lounge in Singapore was so crowded that I left after a while. Shorter flight from Singapore to BKK was uneventful, with a faster service, but still robotic impersonal service.",lunch service took almost 3 hours
Singapore Airlines,"The aircraft used for this short 2 hour flight is the regional business class configuration with 1-2-1 layout. For solo travellers, the window seat is the best option and is arranged in an alternating manner with seats next to the window and next to the aisle respectively. The problem with the seat next to the window is that the winglet of the seat partially obscures the window so you will have to lean forward to look out of the window. On this morning flight I ordered Nasi Lemak for breakfast and it was delicious. Cabin crew were attentive and even for such a short flight the leading stewardess addressed me by name. Overall it was a pleasant flight even though I only had 20 minutes to lie flat before preparation for landing in Singapore.",it was a pleasant flight
Singapore Airlines,"I flew on the new business class product of SQ on their narrow body B737-800 Max to Phuket last month. The new product featured a fully flat reclining seat in a 1-2-1 configuration. For a 90 minute flight, I had a dinner of beef steak which was booked through the Book the Cook service. As expected with steaks on airline menus, the steak was a bit too well done for my taste. As it was a short flight, it was time to descend after the dinner service. I didn’t get to try out the full recline of the seat but it was comfortable with generous pitch in lounge mode. I would definitely recommend the B737-800 Max business class product for regional routes on SQ especially on the longer regional flights of 4-5 hours where you can get a short nap in full bed mode.",recommend the B737-800 Max business class
Singapore Airlines,"I flew with Singapore Airlines from Brisbane to Greece recently and they lost my luggage. The suitcase was returned to me at the end of my holidays (3 weeks later) and caused me to have to change holidays plans, lots of frustration trying to reach someone form the company and incurred unexpected expenses as I landed with no personal belongings. I've sent two separate feedback forms and there has been no reply and when I managed to finally reach someone from their call centre service, they did not know how to help me and put me on hold for half an hour. This is ridiculous customer service for a company which is supposed to be among the best in the world.",they lost my luggage
Singapore Airlines,"Our family flew with Singapore Airlines since long time. We had experienced a wonderful service, especially for kids. We were so disappointed when travelling again this time in July 2022 from Paris to Vietnam via Singapore. Fares were very high but foods were very poor, no more gift for kids, no menu for kids, no snack during long flight. We understand that pandemic may caused difficulty for all airlines, but Singapore Airlines should not cut expenses.",no more gift for kids
Singapore Airlines,"London to Bali via Singapore. Having not travelled overseas for sometime due to the pandemic, I eventually got back to flying in April/May 2022 and it was so nice as I had normally taken a flight on average 20+ times a year prior to the pandemic. Check in was quick and polite checking my PCR result for entry to Bali security was quick and the Singapore Airlines lounge at Heathrow was okay. Boarding was more or less on time the seat as normal on SQ comfortable for the 12 hours flight. The crew where all pretty nice although I sensed perhaps not the normal expected on SQ, the food service was just okay good enough but again not really SQ standard that said the flight was fine. Arrival in Singapore on time I headed to the lounge to wait my connecting flight which was packed with little seating although I managed a shower. SIN-DPS was on the newer 787-10 which I really enjoyed nice crew food okay. I returned DPS-SIN in economy class again on the 787-10 and I was impressed great aircraft nice crew and the economy food box just fine for a 2 hour flight, I obviously like SQ and will continue to use hopefully service will improve as things return to normal",Singapore Airlines customer review
Singapore Airlines,"Singapore Airlines no longer the same, my food tray was near empty. I had chicken noodles, that's about it with a bread. Food was no better from Melbourne to Singapore. The rice with chicken packed with rice and 4 pcs of chicken and a bread. Used to have fruits and cakes, what was called sandwich was a soggy curry puff serves right before landing. From Melbourne to Singapore many were not masked. The air stewardess talked to the unmasked passengers and throughout the flight the passenger was mask off.",food tray was near empty
Singapore Airlines,"The boarding and take-off was delayed. The food on board was beef stew, a piece of cake and a cold, rigid bread. It was very difficult to see for the middle row.

They served me drinks twice during an 8-hour flight, I know we can ask for it any time.",cannot find your seat again
Singapore Airlines,"This airline has good inflight service. However, when I went to check in the agent at San Francisco asked for my vaccine certificate. This is not required at my destination in Cambodia, nothing except rapid test on arrival. I explained this to check in agent. After a while the supervisor took over and checked the requirements on her personal computer. The problem was old requirement were never updated.",airline has good inflight service
Singapore Airlines,"I was very surprised to read some of the comments in the review below. I travelled last week from Singapore to Melbourne on an A350-900 in business class, and it was one of my better flights this year. The seat product for a 7.5 hour flight was very comfortable with good privacy (6/1 tall), and the food and beverages that I was served were all to a good standard. Service was to the usual impeccable SIA standard, and the IFE choices were excellent. I accept that everyone's perceptions can be very different, but maybe sometimes there are some other issues at play when a review is written.",perceptions can be very different
Singapore Airlines,"Boarding was smooth. No welcome-drinks offered, after request I got one. A narrow business-class seat, where I felt squeezed in, a huge console on the left, which is too high to use as an arm-rest and a divider on the right with reading lights.  Sleeping for me was impossible, because the seat/bed is too narrow.  With the exception of slippers no amenities offered, I was re-assured that amenity-kits are available on request. Caesar’s Salad came without dressing and croutons were missing, too. The salad was a green salad-leaf, one in 2 parts cut cherry-tomato and two tiny bits of thinnest parmesan cheese. The 2 choices of white wine were disappointing: both Australian wines, 1 Chardonnay and 1 Riesling. My main course, pan seared salmon was dry and overcooked. The vanilla ice-cream was nice, though and the cheese platter was at least a choice of 3, but served with no grapes. No pralines offered. As for my second meal, Tom Yum Vermicelli with prawns. Again, the dish was small but I could get a vanilla-chocolate cake. The inflight program was functioning, but with little to no choices for me. Since no printed reading material was available I wanted to download some business magazines to my laptop, but was informed, that download is possible on smartphones and tablets only.",little to no choices for me
Singapore Airlines,"I was at the airport early and check-in was supposed to open 3 hours before departure but opened 15 minutes late with long queues for both, economy- and business-class already. No warm welcome back  by the leading stewardess. No welcome-drinks, no hot-towel and with the exception of slippers no amenities. For my after take-off drink I opted for a hot sake. Together with satays as canapés I got a tiny 4cl glass of sake and not the full 180ml bottle. One different guest, however enjoyed the whole bottle by his own – another example, that Solitaire-PPS-membership does not pay out anymore. I ordered a Gin&Tonic instead, delivered to me with my own lemons, which I brought from the Lufthansa-lounge. I also brought my own Lufthansa-refreshing-towels, which the crew chilled for me and brought to me after meals and sleeping. The starter (beef pastrami) was tiny but tasty. The chicken roulade with pretzel stuffing was a pretzel roulade with lots of pretzel outside and a tiny piece of chicken inside, dry and almost tasteless. My choice of wine (Australian Shiraz) was disappointing. Ironically, SIA re-introduced a printed menu, even featuring its ‘wine connoisseurs’ – but the actual wine-list was missing, so I could not verify the exact origin of my wine. The cheese-plate was disappointing consisting of 2 small tiny bits only (before it was at min. 3 choices, being freshly cut) with no grapes, as before. At least the Pumpkin Seed Parfait was nice and I was lucky to get the chocolate cake on request. No pralines. My choice of digestive, the Aberfeldy 16 years’ single malt was not catered for and a Japanese whiskey was offered instead. Why then having a single malt on the menu? As SIA doesn’t hand out any amenities to its business-class passengers,  I brought my own slippers and amenity-kit from a flight with Austrian earlier. The next disappointment was the economy-class-style breakfast with scrambled eggs or egg-noodles (2 different styles, though) and yoghurt or muesli. The only difference to an economy-class breakfast is, that the dishes are being served one after each other, but the sizes are tiny. I was lucky, there were still the seafood noodle soup from lunch left, so I decided for that. No freshly squeezed orange-juice. Thank you SIA for a good flight-experience before Covid. But now, with all the service and amenity-cuts it’s time to say goodbye.",service and amenity-cuts
Singapore Airlines,My initial flight was booked from Singapore to Darwin in April 2022. They cancelled my flight to Darwin for operational reasons and rebooked me after three days. I had to reach Australia earlier than rebooked date. I called the customer line and explained. They charged me to rebook me to a flight to Sydney as they had no other options available to fly me to Darwin. They did not give me a ticket from Sydney to Darwin and I lost a lot of money. Incompetent customer service staff and SQ's attitude to their own cancellation was pathetic. The flight comfort was okay but a big decline in their overall customer care.,cancelled my flight for operational reasons
Singapore Airlines,"After 2 years of not being to fly with them, finally I made it! I was luckily to be chosen to upgrade from PE to J at a very attractive price last minute. It was money really well spent! It was wonderful to step into their premium cabin again, and experienced their excellent seat with many modern features. Their cabin crew are still amongst some of the best in the airline industry. I was greeted warmly and had excellent service from start to end. Having learnt that I was to go to Singapore to visit families and celebrate my birthday, they surprised me with a cake and some inflight goodies, that truly made my day! Personally, on this route, I did not see any decline in quality of meals and service. Except, maybe the lack of welcome drink, hot towels, which is excusable for covid reason. Meals are still served in separate courses, and with wine, which is constantly refilled. J class passengers, even upgraded ones like me, get 100 MB free WiFi, which was generous and very handy.",cabin crew some of the best
Singapore Airlines,"From the moment we got to the check-in to the farewell wishes on disembarkation it felt like we had travelled back in time to the golden days of air travel – this is what it was all about. Truly friendly staff on the ground and in the air, a perfectly clean, spacious and tidy cabin all made for a flight that was most enjoyable from start to finish. I will definitely spend a few dollars more to fly Singapore Airlines in the future.",Truly friendly staff
Singapore Airlines,"I recently flew to/from SFO in Business Class and it was not worth it. On the surface, customer service seemed normal but it was a far cry from the past and not worth the extra money to upgrade from Economy Premium. If you are short like me, sleeping in the cubby hole, in a flat position is fine. Getting the seats up/down is a ridiculous exercise requiring assistance. Not the least bit convenient. It took 4+ hours for the flight staff to get my audio working. Food was some of the worst yet. Trying to get a glass of wine refilled was arduous. Because of all the stories of airline cancellations and delays, I did not risk flying from PDX to SFO with a short layover. Certainly 5 hours was sufficient. Because of the lame check-in policies and process for getting a boarding pass, I was forced to wait 3+ hours for the Singapore counter to open.  The United Lounge at SFO was great. On the flight, it was more of the same, as in the flight to SFO. In addition to the wait for a rest room, no amenities (like socks or travel kit) was offered to me. I will think long and hard before flying their Business Class again.",it was a far cry from the past
Singapore Airlines,"Check-in was fast, because I could use the business-class check-in counters as a PPS-member. Otherwise endless queues. Boarding was slow because the flight was full and I boarded late with the crowds. No recognition as a Solitaire-PPS-member on board as before. Cabin crew busy with 'sorting' the passengers and their cabin-luggage to not miss our slot. Seat in a 3-3-3 configuration very narrow, seat-pitch ok (for me being 1.7m only) sufficient, however. Left channel of my speakers was not working, even after exchanging them. Internet not working on my phone, either. No help given to connect, as on earlier flights, instead 'proof' was given to me by a flight attendant that Internet was working on her iphone. Not really helpful. No reading materials. Very basic and little food-options offered in a tiny cardboard-box, 'designed for a reason' (whatever this reason may be). Very inattentive inflight-cabin-crew: As for the after dinner drink I was ignored by the them while my two seat-members got served their drinks of choice. Minimum seat-recline, similar to those in budget-airlines. No soap in washroom. No disinfectant-kits offered as advertised, I got one after request only. Wearing a mask, which is 'mandatory' was not re-enforced, a man in the middle seat was wearing his mask under his chin - no one of the crew cared. Overall the crew seemed to be overworked and de-motivated. The typical glass of champagne offered to me as a PPS-member when I raised my concerns did not really help, it just would have been good enough if the cabin-crew would have fulfilled their duties. Disembarking was fast and swift as well as delivery of my checked-in baggage.",the crew seemed to be overworked and de-motivated
Singapore Airlines,"The flight to London from Belfast was delayed, and I only managed to reach counter at 1100. I was told that I am not able to board SQ317, which depart at 1125. However, I was told by the ground staff not to stress and was assured that they will try to work things out. Throughout the process, they were very friendly, professional and prompt to get me a flight SQ305 back to Singapore on the same day, which departs at 1255. In fact, they get me a aisle seat with leg space. Having stressed out the whole morning with the delayed earlier flight, I breathed a sigh of relief. Thanks to ground staff Preeti and Kaye.",Thanks to ground staff

Singapore Airlines,"The second leg of my trip from Hanoi to San Francisco was on SQ032 on June 16th, and this is the flight I wish to review because my reserved seat was not honored. I was first given a seat which was totally unacceptable and I requested another aisle seat. The second seat was in the exit row directly next to the door (facing the crew jump seats). This new seat had no storage pockets since there was no seat in front, and had both monitor and tray table attached. The toilets were directly behind the crew seats giving me little if any privacy and almost no chance to sleep with the toilet traffic. It is true that this new seat had extra leg room. I was quite miserable in this seat due to the lack of privacy and I had to use the floor for my storage needs. Thank god for the snacks in the rear because the 2 meals served were pretty bad. The flight attendants were most helpful throughout the flight, but I will seriously consider my options when flying this route in the future.",my reserved seat was not honored
Singapore Airlines,"Singapore Airline is an expensive budget airline. The service was very poor, the call center the worst. This flight I had the worst food in business class I had experienced. Service is slow always and wine options are like economy. Wi-if not working for the overall trip.",worst food in business class
Singapore Airlines,"Our first family holiday (with 2 young children) since pandemic hit. Even with the changes due to COVID (no hot towel etc), the standard remains remarkable, especially the warmness of the cabin crews and extra care towards our 4 year old and 6 year old children. Drinks were replenished throughout the flight. Food and drinks were great with book the chef option. We had the signature Lobster dish and the meat was as tender as it can get, for an in flight meal. Departure and Arrival were on time as usual, and great effort by the cabin crew.","the standard remains remarkable,"
Singapore Airlines,"Prior to flying I had a nightmare trying to rearrange my flight when quarantine rules changed. Emails were not replied to and the UK telephone line required a pin to proceed.  The change I required was not possible online. I purchased an aisle seat but I was not allocated one when they changed my booking. The flight was very disappointing. We took off about 12.30pm. After 1 and a half hours were served a curry and rice, a roll and ice cream. There were only two drinks service during a flight of more than 12 and a half hours. Our second meal, breakfast was served 9.5 hours later. Unfortunately my seat was near the galley and the door to staff quarters and the crew slammed the door nearly every ten minutes and were really inconsiderate I thought. I was quite disgruntled so attempted to get a refund on the seats I had purchased and voice my complaints. Yet again I have found it impossible to contact them.",flight was very disappointing
Singapore Airlines,"Singapore Airlines is no longer what it used to be. The call centre is a disgrace and fails miserably in its job. Check-in was chaotic. Inflight service has dropped to dismal levels. There is no welcome drink, no hot towels, no menus given. The meals were one of the worst I have ever had. The eggs were dry and rubbery. I have had far better meals in the economy class on Flydubai which is a budget airline.",meals were one of the worst
Singapore Airlines,"Best aircraft in the fleet! I was a little apprehensive flying on the 737 Max8 from Phuket but this turned out to be the jewel in the fleet. A beautiful spacious modern aircraft with unusually good legroom. No need to upgrade for this short flight. The catering let the side down. OK it was a short flight but serving wet noodles in a cardboard carton is not sensible. It’s too easy to spill or splash down your shirt, not a good look. There was some turbulence after about 30 minutes and the fasten seatbelt signs came on. Unfortunately, they stayed on for the remainder of the flight even though the turbulence ended after 4-5 minutes barring access to the lavatories. SIN-LHR on an A380. A complete nightmare.  I had an aisle seat with a very large male next to me spilling into my seat space for 13+ hours. This was forcing me into the aisle space where the crew repeatedly knocked into me either rushing down the plane or bashing me with the catering trollies resulting in no sleep. There was never an apology from any of the crew. The food was only just enough with many of the previously supplied items missing. I will never use them again.",The food was only just enough
Singapore Airlines,"First flight on 26th April was a tatty 777-300. The saving grace was no passenger in the middle seat.  The carpet in the aisle was threadbare. The seating upholstery was no better, very scruffy. No fruit, no salad, no cheese & crackers and only one choice for breakfast. A cold roll was served but only butter to put on it, no conserves. No pre meal drink service. One beer or 1 glass of wine served with the meal. No wifi all flight. The in flight entertainment had to be rebooted 5 times. The crew were very good on this leg regularly passing through the cabin with water. SIN - BKK a more modern A350. I was looking forward to my 1st flight on an A350. The seats were thin with little support. Again the only saving grace was no centre seat occupant. The crew seemed to be in training with young people following older crew members around. I purposely selected Singapore Airlines for my flight following their pre-covid reputation at extra expense.",No wifi all flight
Singapore Airlines,"SIN-EWR: Purchased a ticket, with one of the 1/6 Standalone Premium Economy Seats. Check in at Changi quick. Tried to purchase lounge access but was turned down. The gate was opened 50 minutes prior to boarding. Boarding was smooth, on what seemed to be a full flight. Seat, and adjacent stowage bin were perfect. Bin could comfortably hold my Rimowa Attaché, but not Business Class. Took off on time, flew a different route than the incoming flight. Flew asleep, Cabin Crew gently tapped me on the shoulder, to eat. Have had ANA, and EVA let me sleep, and tag my seat returning later. Meal was good, Mushrooms had lots of flavor. Two-three rounds of drinks included. Recommenced sleep, and woke up. Cabin crew appeared taking drink orders, and brought back snacks. Crew continuously smiled, were warm, and professional, throughout the flight. They continued to check in, and ensure I didn’t go empty. Second meal served, again with endless drink rounds. IFE was not up to par, with what I’ve previously experienced on Singapore Airlines. Landed at EWR on time, with my bag quickly appearing. Would definitely fly Singapore Airlines again.",definitely fly Singapore Airlines again
Singapore Airlines,"On 25th May I flew on SQ736 to Phuket. A young child was running up and down the aisle, during turbulence, approach and after landing, during taxi to gate. The parents absolutely didn’t care and the cabin crew didn’t either.",child was running up and down the aisle
Singapore Airlines,"After having recently also travelled on Emirates I thought it might be interesting to compare business class on Singapore Airlines. Singapore Airlines travel was Brisbane to Munich and Frankfurt to Brisbane, both of course, via Singapore. Both trips were 'busy' business trips where everything needed to be on time and hassle-free. Singapore Airlines exuded high quality personal service. Aircraft were spotless and cabins quiet, including on one sector (Singapore-Brisbane) when a number of babies turned up. Disappointing was the food and wine including the choices available. Emirates was far better in this category. Also, Singapore Airlines had no hot towels or printed menus. Maybe this was due to recent COVID issues but the comparison with Emirates was stark. Also Lounge access and quality was very poor. The Silver Kris Lounge in Singapore at midnight resembled a packed works canteen on a bad day. Boarding was quite chaotic at a number of places, especially at Frankfurt - which often seems to be the case for these Singapore Airlines A380 flights out of Frankfurt. Nevertheless, the quality of the cabin staff on all sectors was absolutely superb. Lets hope the quality of food and wine improves to how it once was.",Lets hope the quality of food and wine improves to how it once was
Singapore Airlines,"Business class in the longest commercial flight: Purchased tickets in February. SQ counter at EWR, opened what I thought was rather late, considering the Pandemic. Previously at JFK, FRA their counters opened earlier. Check in quick, efficient, and no stress. Virgin Atlantic Lounge was nice, however No alcohol at that early in the morning.  We boarded on time. Upon sitting was greeted, with my Surname, and welcomed aboard. My Rimowa case would not fit in any of the spaces, and had to be stowed overhead. Airborne and I had my lunch order taken. I had the Braised Shortribs. Constant, Infinite drink rounds during the flight, with my Surname used. Over Turkey, they served the second meal, I had the Thai Chicken, lots of flavor but seemed rather small.  I sent some texts to friends and proceeded to get a few hours sleep. Landed in Changi on time, with a speedy stop in Immigration, and my case was one of the first 10 out. I Have been flying with Singapore Airlines since 2008, will definitely continue to fly with them.",definitely continue to fly with them

No tooth-brush- or shaving-kits in the washrooms, instead on request an amenity-kit containing a tooth-brush-set and a pair of socks. The quality and quantity of food is lowered significantly, with cold food items covered by plastic. The cheese plate is pre-packed with 2 tiny choices. I was lucky to get as a Solitaire PPS member a second one. There was not even a slice of lemon for a good glass of tea or a simple Gin Tonic available. Wines are  offered based on red or white. Only after request, the bottles are shown. Yet, any description of the taste and the drinking experience is – thanks to the no menu. Same for food: no chance to enhancing your appetite by looking at the menu upfront, no chance to check quickly what kind of food you are enjoying right now because you need to open the digital menu – which means you have to pause the movie you are watching, search for the meal menu to finally get to the description of dishes - I did not manage to find it. No pralines are offered after the main meal anymore. No Grand Marnier Cordon Rouge available any more. No hot towels to refresh after boarding, after the meal or sleep.

Singapore Airlines,"We had a very unpleasant experience with Singapore Airlines. We have originally purchased our ticket to India from Auckland to Delhi and from Delhi to Auckland via Melbourne, leaving on the 9th of April and coming back on the 24th of April. We have received an email on 11th of February that our flight SQ4235 has been cancelled from Melbourne to Auckland. We have contacted the call centre and tried to rebook our flight. We choose the option of rebooking on 31st of May from Delhi to Auckland via Singapore so we have less transfers, flight number SQ403 and SQ4281 operated by Air New Zealand. The call centre operator informed us that all the economy tickets were sold on those flights, so we have an option to purchase Premium Economy tickets by paying an extra $937.60 NZD. We were charged this amount on 6th of March. We were excited to come back to Auckland and for first time in our life in Premium Economy. Unfortunately, our excitement was totally crushed when we realized we can only board the plane in economy class upon check in online. We have tried to contact the call centre again but were unable to get hold on an operator 3 times (we totally understand the current circumstances). The Delhi Airport staff were lovely but were unable to upgrade our tickets. We don't mind Economy tickets as we normally would not upgrade our flights but, in this case, we had no other choice and were charged an extra amount for nothing.",Singapore Airlines customer review

Singapore Airlines,"My recent flights with Singapore airlines were some of the worst travel experiences I have had. We have been unable to travel to New Zealand for almost 3 years due to the pandemic. As borders were finally open we booked flights with Singapore Airlines, which were more expensive than any other airline, thinking spending more money would be worth it after such a long wait .. how wrong were we! Our outbound flight, SQ 305 on 17 March 2022 from London to Singapore was delayed by 1 hour and 53 minutes, which led to us being unable to make our connection flight to Auckland, SQ 281 on 18 March 2022. They then had a technical fault also and the flight was further delayed, causing our missed connection time to Auckland. The staff onboard the plane had no idea what was going to happen, and even though most of the aircraft had connections to make, they gave us no information and were incredibly unhelpful. Once we arrived in Singapore, it was an even worse state of affairs. We were greeted by a makeshift desk with everyone scrambling to give out new tickets (there were literally hundreds of people with missed connections). We were told we had missed our flight, and the next connection was 14 hours away. No food vouchers, no hotel rooms offered. We were told all the airport hotels were booked, however we walked to and managed to get a room, at our own cost. The next flight was also packed, and even though my partner and I had paid extra money for seats together, the new plane was unable to accommodate this and we had to sit separately. My partner has food intolerances, and none of his meals was catered for on the next 10-hour-long flight. He was offered some crisps and that was all for the entire flight. We honestly could not believe how bad the whole journey had been and arrived in Auckland completely and utterly exhausted. A really bad start to a trip we had been looking forward to for such a long time. On our return flight, we luckily made our connection. I would say the meals and customer service have gone downhill and it did not feel like we were traveling on a premium airline. Since being home, we have complained to Singapore Airlines and asked for a refund/compensation for our outward flight and the hotel we had to pay for. However, they claim it is not their fault and is refusing any refunds.",asked for a refund/compensation
Singapore Airlines,"After spending a little more on the flight than intended after flying on this return journey with Singapore was happy I did as the overall experience was second to none. The check in at LHR was seamless even with the necessary Covid checks in place and being done efficiently by the check in staff. Boarding the plane I immediately became aware of the Singapore girl exceptional customer service the airline is known for. The food service was efficient and rapid and there was a wide selection of other snacks available with a fruit bowl also with crisps etc for during the flight. The flight to Manila was smooth, service was also great even in the smaller less crowded flight. The staff continued to deliver amazing professionalism and attention to detail. The attention to detail became very noticeable on the return flight from Singapore to London. After another comfortable and pro professional flight from Manila I boarded the flight to London and for reasons unknown, my booked seat hadn't been reserved.  I was one of the first on, as I prefer to also sit at the back of the plane, and I mentioned it to the cabin crew who immediately took me off the plane, against the flow of oncoming passengers (I was that guy and felt very embarrassed) took me to the ground staff who radioed to the gate to change my boarding pass to an aisle seat which they did without any fuss or questions asked. As I had now moved seats and there are only so many meals in the trolley to cater for the expected number of passengers in each specific areas on the plane, my moving now had to be factored in and to my surprise I overheard once cabin crew day to the other Mr Taylor has moved from seat 67f to 46h. When I left the plane the cabin crew by the door said Thank you for flying, See you again soon Mr Taylor Overall Singapore airlines for me is hands down the best and aside from the ground team at Singapore airport the experience was amazing and I will definitely be booking my flights with them again. Hopefully to try out their world class business class.",the experience was amazing
Singapore Airlines,"The airline refuses to refund my ticket for May 2022. The request to instead rebook my ticket if a refund is not possible was also never replied to. I had contacted the airlines on april 20th via their portal and have not received any answer until now. I had also called their customer service last week and had to wait 1 hour until someone picked up. The person that picked up was not helpful at all, putting me on hold for at least another 20 minutes in total. In the end my request to refund the ticket into credits or money or at least rebook the ticket in the same class for another date was not fulfilled. I was told I could expect another call from a manager in the same week which did not happen.",refuses to refund my ticket
Singapore Airlines,"I have flown SQ many times but I feel the standards are dropping. Contacting customer service was impossible. Call back takes about 3 working days. No issue with check in. Boarding as expected. The lounge in Singapore is very disappointing. Poor selection food, over crowded, reasonable service.  On flight service is ok, efficient but not warm. Seats are good but dated. Food above average but no welcome drink or towel. I was ignored during the long 13h flight unless you ask for help. Don’t get me wrong, SQ is still above average but losing ground fast. They need to buck up. Start by improving customer service, don’t keep us waiting for hours for a reply on CHAT.",I feel the standards are dropping
Singapore Airlines,"The check-in process at JFK was the worst check-in experience I've experienced. I was waiting for check-in for over 2 hours. The line just didn't move at all. The agent was extremely inefficient. I was one of the last customers to check in and it was about 30 minutes before the departure time. The counter agents was escorting a group of last-to-check-in customers to the security checkpoint so they could skip the line (we were late) and somehow I was the only one who left in the security line on my own. The service on board was terrible despite the high-regarded in-flight service that Singapore Airlines is usually known for. The service was so slow for a flight with only 160 customers.  I sat at one of the single seat toward the end of the aircraft and the steward kept bumping into me like I was sitting on the aisle. He didn't even apologize. My food was OK at best. The worst part was probably the lavatories. Truly disgusting, trash was everywhere on the floor.",waiting for check-in for over 2 hours
Singapore Airlines,"My wife and I booked a ticket to Manila from London. A few weeks after we booked we received an e-mail that very clearly stated that we could upgrade to Business class and showed a price We jumped at it and booked. We got an email saying we were upgraded on the 2nd leg from Singapore to Manila. I called and was told we were not upgraded on the London Manila leg as Business class was full. I told the CS rep that we did not need Business class for a 3 hour flight and requested a refund, the lady went to ask her supervisor who then told us company policy was no refunds. We went from being a happy customer to a very unhappy one. The food was the same as all other airlines, nothing memorable. The in flight staff were great. We are disabled. Very average service. Much better on our usual carrier, Qatar Airways. We had a bad experience 7 years ago with SQ and swore never to fly them again. I wish we had kept to that decision.",Very average service
Singapore Airlines,The SQ system can almost never get mileage accrual nor ticket changes right. I have called them 29 times in the last 12 months and the contact number has an average waiting time of just over 1 hour.  I wasted so much time with them on the line. The service has been downgraded so much. Most amenities are gone. My food was of very low quality and Book the chef is mostly not available (even if they claim they are on the website).,service has been downgrade
Singapore Airlines,I just had the worst experience at Paris CDG Airport. Their baggage weight policies are insane.  I was in Nairobi then Paris coming from NY. Decided to extend through Singapore heading to Hanoi. I have been allowed 50lbs (about 23kgs) by every airline but Singapore Airlines only allow 30 kgs total and they tried to charge me $700 for about 16 extra kgs. I ended up arguing with them and took some stuff out of my and stuck it in my jacket and carry on.,Singapore Airlines only allow 30 kgs total
Singapore Airlines,"Onboard service, food, seats, and entertainment are good. Sudden and unreasonable pricing policy changes? Totally annoying. During corona, SQ sold Economy (lite/value/standard) Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) tickets with certain terms and conditions for each class. Economy Lite offered what I needed: (1) lowest fare, (2) 25kg check in, (3) ability to change parts of the trip (before use) without additional fees, if whole return ticket price was similar/cheaper as original ticket. Changing ticket worked fine, and made me very happy with my purchase. However, since travel restrictions in Singapore have been relaxed, SQ has changed their pricing policies without notice (as in their small letters). Now they charge you unreasonable for a ticket price change: (1) Flight leg you want to change, (2) Look at one-way ticket prices for that leg of your trip (rather than whole ticket prices, as before), (3) your full trip fare that you paid, is then deducted from the one-way ticket price (which is often double that of a new return ticket on similar dates), (4) you're asked to pay the remaining difference in order to change your ticket.",unreasonable pricing policy changes
Singapore Airlines,There was no water or juice served for one and half hours which was ridiculous. Food serving was chaotic as crew moving back wards and forwards in a disorganised fashion. We ordered Hindu non veg meal and ordered meal were missing from the cabin crew list. Quantity of my food was horrific. Service was all over the place and chaotic. When I questioned they said there are 30 kids travelling on a full flight.,Service was all over the place

Qatar Airways,"I have sent 5 emails and have only received 2 automatic response emails after initiating our complaint 10 weeks ago. I have sent all of the relevant documentation to support our claim for a refund. Our group of 3 booked adjoining Exit Row seats on the Upper Deck of an A380 from Doha to Perth after a connecting flight from Amman. We paid for our Exit Row seats on August 22 2023 and received email confirmation that day. What was a shock to us is that when we were at Amman airport we got our tickets for the second leg, from Doha to Perth, we saw that we had been seats on the lower deck. We said this was wrong and showed our August confirmation for seats 30 A, B and C on the upper deck. We were told by Qatar Airways staff in Amman that it could only be fixed up in Doha. We were also told that the reason was that the plane had been changed from an A380 (which was not correct) . Our connecting flight from Amman to Doha was not only cancelled but deleted altogether meaning we had a 10.5 hour transit instead of the original 2.5 hours. Then at the Boarding Gate in Amman we were informed that there were 2 Exit Row seats available in the Upper Deck and that these had been put on hold for us and to see the Qatar Ground staff in Doha. We were in a queue for almost an hour at the Qatar Service Desk in Doha. I asked how the seats we had booked and paid extra for in August, and provided emails and a hard copy to verify this, were no longer available for us? We were told that it was a system error. There was no apology at all for the system error. We were further disappointed to find out that the 2 Exit Row seats on the Upper Deck that we had been told by staff at the boarding Gate at Amman had been “reserved” were not actually retained for us and that only 1 Exit Row seat was available. Understandably we were not happy that we did not receive the Exit Row seats that we had booked and paid for more than 3 months prior. Through no fault of our own we were victims of a Qatar Airways system error. We did not complain to the flight attendants on the Doha to Perth flight as we understood that they had no control over the seat allocation. However, we politely asked the people in seats 30A and 30B, that we had paid for in August, when they had purchased their seats and were informed that they had done so about 2 weeks prior. I chose Exit Row seats on the Upper Deck because of the extra space and the cabin configuration of 2 by 4 by 2 seats and because my wife and I would be seated next to each other and the other member of our group would be in the next available Exit Row seat. Instead of all being seated next to each other in Exit Row seats we were split up and certainly didn’t get what we paid for. Plus all of the wasted time trying unsuccessfully in Amman and then at the Transit Desk in Doha to sort out the error created by Qatar Airways assigning our seats to someone else. It is bad enough that we didn’t get 2 of the Exit Row seats that we had paid for that were allocated to other people who booked well after us. What is worse is that there has been no attempt by Qatar Airways to address our complaint let alone issue the refund to which we are entitled. Our complaint isn’t complex.",no attempt to address our complaint
Qatar Airways,We flew on probably the first A380 the airline received but it’s up keep is very good the caviar was excellent and the rack of lamb was perfect the entertainment system though the screens were huge and not very cooperative it is very dated as for WiFi was bad to say the least. The seating in First Class was good and the toilets are huge I hope they update the A380.,“I hope they update the A380”
Qatar Airways,"Service was ok, pretty good on my aisle and extremely slow where my wife was seated. Layout was good, but not exceptional, I’d rate them maybe 7/10. Landing in Doha, we then had quite a long wait for steps to be brought to the aircraft and then a 10 to 15 minute bus ride to the terminal. There is a lot of competition for routes from Europe to Australasia and think I’ll pick one of the other options in future.",I’d rate them maybe 7/10
Qatar Airways,"12th February 2024 From check in to get onboard remarkable experience. Since steping at Hamad International airport every one was so welcoming. Check in agent was very professional and helpful. Al mourjan lounge was realy good. Great tasting food. On board all cabin crew was kind professional welcoming. Seat very good, leg space and incredible service, and a very clean plane. Inflight entertainment was great too. The staff was very polite. Arriving at London, Qatar staff gave me Fast track card that helps me to pass imigration quick. Thank you Qatar Airways.",remarkable experience
Qatar Airways,"My last travel in January 2024 the food quality and presentation had deteriorated and the service. During  booking one has to pay for seats in case one does not want to wait until check-in. On the first leg the crew mechanically did their job. It is ok, but not what you expect from Qatar Airways. Amenity kits are not provided any longer on every flight during the night. Nonetheless you sometimes still find the old welcoming and service oriented Qatar Airways spirit. The crew on the second leg was outstanding as well as ground staff at JRO. Flying Qatar Airways is still a good value for money, but it was not the extraordinary experience.",not the extraordinary experience
Qatar Airways,"What a trip, highest level possible, probably. Lounge in Frankfurt a bit underwhelming as Qatar uses Priority Pass Lounge that isn’t up to Qatar‘s standards.

Food outstanding, wine list outstanding, seat (and sleep) comfort outstanding: you can’t get it any better!",can’t get it any better
Qatar Airways,"No complaints about the service or products onboard. However, they lost my bag at JFK for a week, and when I had to waste a day of my own vacation time to go buy some clothes, they refuse to fully reimburse me and I had to chase and jump through hoops to get any compensation offer from them.  It has been few months, and I have not gotten anything yet. All this over a couple hundred dollars; it's utterly disgraceful.",refuse to fully reimburse me
Qatar Airways,"When I arrived at my departing airport, Baltimore Washington, my flight was cancelled for my first leg due to bad weather. This part of the flight is with American Airlines. American had no other flights leaving BWI for the rest of the day and I needed to get a connecting flight from Chicago to Doha. They only could offer a flight leaving the next nearest airport 40 miles away w/ no way to get there and it would also change my return flight to that same airport. This was not an option for me so I decided to make a last-minute decision to fly another airline that was flying out of BWI at a cost. I figured I could get refunded for that part of the flight from Qatar or even American - sadly not. American told me that Qatar would have to refund it. On the ground at the airport in CHI, it was a mess. It took an hour to get through check-in. While weather was bad, there were enough agents. Getting to the gate and waiting to board wasn't a problem. I got an upgraded seat in economy class that had plenty of space. My return flight I picked the same seat and had another seatmate with an upgraded experience. Now between these two fights I'd say the first wasn't as bad because the attendant also gave me my food right after my seatmate. Shouldn't be an issue , since you have the cart of food right there. Why on the return flight I didn't get my meal until the attendant came back after he went up to the front of the plane. Inflight entertainment was top notch. There were plenty of movies, TV shows and music. The internet was choppy w/ my device so I just stayed w/ the entertainment they provided. I also think the food was great. I enjoyed all meals and they were portioned just right. As for the issue of my refund, I'm still fighting.",Inflight entertainment was top notch
Qatar Airways,Have been using Qatar Airways for years and they never let us down. From the check in desk in Nice to the arrival in Doha can’t fault the trip. The staff on the plane are so very pleasant and always come to see us just to check if we need anything. Will continue to use them and definitely recommend them.,definitely recommend them
Qatar Airways,"I flew Qatar Airways during the COVID pandemic and they were wonderful in the air but not so good on the ground. At Doha , passengers are jammed in a small boarding area with insufficient seats or air conditioning and the boarding proceeds in an undignified scramble. Once on board, the Qatar quality starts. Welcoming drink, a very spacious Q suite and a comfortable seat. Dinner was delicious with a dry Riesling and later on breakfast was equally good. No other airline comes anywhere close to Qatar.",No other airline comes anywhere close
Qatar Airways,"Firstly I must state that on three of the legs of my journey to Penang and back to Birmingham were excellent. On 23 September boarded flight from Penang to Doha. There is a short hop from Penang to Phuket and the crew were very good, a special note for Melissa who was friendly, engaging and attentive and a credit to Qatar Airways. However everything changed when a new crew embarked at Phuket. They were sullen and unsmiling from the outset. Service was abysmal. Tablecloths were given as serviettes and getting a glass of wine or water was like getting blood from a stone. Distribution of food was chaotic. I am not sure if this was the fault of the Cabin Manager or the individual flight attendants or some disagreement among the crew. Whatever, it was not the standard expected from business class on Qatar. Shortly before landing the Cabin Manager did his rounds and I stated I was unhappy with the service...about 10 minutes later he returned and asked for more information. If Qatar Airways read these comments I hope they investigate this matter and it was a blotch on the otherwise excellent service I was provided by other aircrews.",“it was not the standard expected”
Qatar Airways,"When my flight with Qatar was delayed through no fault of Qatar, fog bound, in Georgia I experienced Qatar at its worst. Planes flew the next morning but we had a 26 hour delay. When they sent us to a very nice hotel they had only one hour person issuing vouchers and hotel arrangements for a plane load. They transferred us to the hotel and we returned to the airport and we sat and watched the following days scheduled flight, that we were meant to be on, leave with passengers and we had to sit and wait another 2 hours, which was consequently delayed another hour through unexplained circumstances which caused for an additional six hour layover in Doha. On checking in again I had a silver pass and there were three of us lined up for business class check in. My friend in economy was 30 deep and she got served before I did. We then had three gate changes without any announcements, we had to find the gates and on the boards there was no information as to what flight was leaving. They bussed us out to the plane on the tarmac in Georgian winter weather, there was no covered canopy on the stairs up to the plane as we stood in the rain waiting to board. I contacted Qatar help on the number given to me by Qatar and they said I have to email talk to us which only responded to half my email.  When I wrote a complaint I was addressed using a wrong name.  I wrote earlier in 2023 about a sublime flight, as they say from the sublime to the ridiculous.",no covered canopy on the stairs
Qatar Airways,"First time travelling long distance by Qatar Airways. It was a 17hr flight. Cabin is well-maintained and clean, very spacious for 900/1000 series. The leg space was ample and seat space is great too. The cabin crews are friendly and professional but among them, there is 1 steward who went extra miles to make my journey extra special. He seems like the most junior one but he was very confident and helpful. As I was traveling with a broken foot, he assisted me with my hand carry bags till the point I left the cabin (taken over by ground staff). Every crew did their jobs but he made an extra effort to help a passenger. Thank You for his kindness.",“cabin crews are friendly and professional”
Qatar Airways,"I have flown with Qatar in economy, business and in first class. I fly two or three times a year with them. I recently had the privilege of experiencing the epitome of airborne luxury aboard the world's best airline, and I must say that the exceptional service provided by the cabin crew left an indelible mark on my travel experience. From the moment I stepped on board until the final descent, every aspect of the journey was a testament to the dedication and professionalism of the airline's remarkable cabin crew. Beyond the technical aspects of the service, what truly set this airline's cabin crew apart was their genuine warmth and hospitality. It was evident that they enjoyed their work and took pride in creating a positive and enjoyable atmosphere for passengers. Whether it was a friendly conversation, a reassuring smile, or going the extra mile to accommodate special requests, the cabin crew consistently exceeded expectations. In conclusion, the world's best airline undoubtedly boasts the world's best cabin crew. Their commitment to excellence, attention to detail, and genuine hospitality set a standard that other airlines would do well to emulate. Traveling with this airline is not just a journey; it's an unforgettable experience that leaves passengers feeling pampered, valued, and eager to embark on their next adventure with the finest cabin crew in the skies.",genuine warmth and hospitality
Qatar Airways,"Four excellent flights, including two ultra-long haul flights from Doha-Auckland return, and all were excellent. Cabins were clean, comfortable and spacious. Meals were decent - maybe a bit on the small side, but good quality. IFE was also good, plenty of choices there. What really stood out though was the service - staff were almost consistently friendly, polite, attentive and caring. I had a couple of crew who really looked out for me, introducing themselves, offering regular drink top-ups (decent selection of wines were offered) and priority meal selection as a silver FF member. I find this impressive for a low silver status. Great flights!",Four excellent flights
Qatar Airways,"Upon arriving in Doha, a 30-minute bus ride from the plane to the terminal and an interminable wait at security caused me to miss my connecting flight. What followed was a horrendous 18-hour layover during which I was denied accommodation and food assistance. The transfer desk's response? No hotels available for you. I discovered available rooms at nearby hotels myself, costing me £300. This level of service is beyond comprehension, Qatar Airways left me out in the cold with expenses I should never have incurred. In my extensive travels, I have never encountered such incompetence and lack of empathy.",lack of empathy
Qatar Airways,"Following a downgrade of my flight Bali to London from business to a seat first in Economy and then a seat without power or possibility to move it, Qatar Airways offered me a ridiculous compensation of 10k avios worth 100$. No alternative business flight was offered and the compensation is an insult given the price of the ticket.",offered me a ridiculous compensation
Qatar Airways,Doha to Goa in Business Class on Boeing 787-8. This 3 hours flight was on time. Business Class seat configuration was the older product (no Qsuite) but very comfortable nevertheless. Flawless onboard service that we have come to expect from Qatar. Summary: it doesn't get better than Qatar Airways in Business Class.,“Flawless onboard service”
Qatar Airways,"Copenhagen to Doha in Business Class on a Boeing 787-9. Qatar Airways lived up to its reputation as the finest Business Class product. On this 787-9, the seats were the older type (not the Qsuite) but very comfortable nevertheless. Onboard service was flawless. Qatar serves meals on demand in Business Class. If there is one point of criticism it is that the food served could do with more attention to both the quality and care in preparation. WiFi worked very well throughout the flight. All in all, a relaxing, comfortable flight.",“lived up to its reputation”
Qatar Airways,"The in flight staff was not attentive at all. Requested mango juice as part of lunch, never arrived. The attendant never came to offer me snacks or drinks. Paid 1200£ for a economy ticket, but received a below average service from this staff. It's their responsibility to attend every customer during the flight, they failed badly with me.",received a below average
Qatar Airways,"Flight to Doha was good. Qatar ground crew sent a message to arrive at the airport 4 hours before departure because of possible delays due construction. We arrived at the airport as instructed but there were no one at the check in counters. The counters were opened 3 hours before departure as usual. When I asked the Qatar agent on why we had to arrive 4 hours before departure, she didn’t know why and she opened the counters 3 hours before departure as scheduled. We requested for a wheel chair for 1 passenger when we booked the tickets, but we had to go back to the agent to order a wheelchair. We waited at a designated spot but no one came. We went through security to the lounge where they promptly got us a wheelchair to get to the gate.",Flight to Doha was good
Qatar Airways,"I found the cabin crew very professional, courteous, proactive, and without a doubt they clearly enjoyed their job. The meals served were most enjoyable and well presented. The flight of 7 and 13 hours soon passed without any problems, well worth it.",found the cabin crew very professional
Qatar Airways,"We booked and confirmed our tickets to India 9 months before the date of departure. (ATH-DOH, DOH-CCU). At some point and close to departure date, we received an email from Qatar informing us that our flights were cancelled, and we should either ask for refund or reschedule. Our already booked program and domestic flights did not allow us to cancel and rebook new flights. A very polite Qatar staff assisted us over the phone to reschedule by adding an extra flight and 6-7 hrs additional traveling time to our outgoing flights (ATH-SAW-DOH-CCU) Waiting time in Doha for our connection was 50 min on both legs outgoing and returning. On both trips upon arrival at DOH , there was a lengthy bus ride from the plane to the terminal of almost 15-20 min which was followed by a hurried security check and then a sprint to the gate to catch the next flight, which we boarded last, to realize that our initially booked and prepaid seats  were messed up. The issue was smoothly and quickly resolved by the very polite and mindful cabin manager on QR 203 on Dec 17th. In any case, our mixed feelings from our eventful Qatar booking experience, were all surpassed by the positive impression of the cabin crew's extraordinary efficiency and professionality. All Qatar accolades go to the hard working cabin crew. I also wish to highlight the better passenger experience that the A350 offers compared to the one on B787, which felt very cramped.",extraordinary efficiency and professionality
Qatar Airways,"I flew from Ho Chi Minh friday the 5th of January 2024. I had a panic attack due to a fit of claustrophobia. I have never tried it before. It was one of the worst things I have ever tried. The staff were absolutely wonderful. I do hope this message can reach the staff somehow. I really want to thank them. So hereby, thank you very much for your kindness and understanding!",“staff were absolutely wonderful”
Qatar Airways,"Check in at DUS airport well organized and efficient. DUS third party lounge was nothing to shout about. Departure delayed by about an hour due to late arrival of incoming aircraft, no prior information given, the first info was given 10 min after the proposed boarding time. SMS from Qatar was received while on the plane already. Boarding rather chaotic despite 8 gate agents. But part of the boarding issues could be contributed to the increasingly impatient crowd. Flight was good with great catering and service. The usual remote stand arrival in Doha with longish bus transfer. Service at lounge was good. Departure gate for the next flight very crowded and also chaotic and unorganized. The poor sole agent at the door had to endure a lot of shouting and pushing; the zone system simply does not work at Doha airport. Flight itself was full and unremarkable, with average catering and service. WiFi didn’t work again throughout the entire flight. Arrival at &BKK also at a remote stand and long bus transfer.",great catering and service
Qatar Airways,"I booked a round-trip flight from MXP to BKK via DOH that, on paper, should have been very comfortable: 1-2-1 configuration on the first leg and Qsuites on the second leg. The day before travelling I received the email from Qatar Airways, informing me of the change of aircraft. I understand that, in certain circumstances, airlines have to change aircrafts for operational reasons from time to time, but when this happens and ends up in a sort of downgrade, it becomes quite annoying. The DOH-BKK flight, originally equipped with Qsuites, was replaced by an old 777 with a 2-2-2 configuration. I had to sleep on a very uncomfortable angled bed. Qatar Airways, in the email sent to me the day before the departure, wanted to emphasize two things:  If I wanted to keep the Qsuites, I could change dates for free; I obviously contacted them immediately and they proposed an alternative to me, but they told me that I would have to pay another 2700 EUR. I don't quite understand the meaning of free in it. Alternatively, despite the lack of Qsuites, I could still take advantage of all the luxury and comfort of Qatar Airways. My attempts to obtain a partial refund, even in the form of Avios were completely ignored.",attempts to obtain a partial refund were ignored
Qatar Airways,"Well coordinated airbridge (a rarity at Doha airport nowadays) boarding. Newish B789 with comfortable seats, large and responsive IFE screens and decent food. Cabin crew was enthusiastic and helpful. Flight arrived ahead of time.",crew was enthusiastic and helpful
Qatar Airways,"Flight on time, remote stand bus transfer in BKK, something I have not seen in BKK for many years for a full service carrier and in Doha. The B773 was rather old, cold draft from exit door, my touch screen not well responding, food ok, seats narrow and uncomfortable. This was a very average flight.",seats narrow and uncomfortable
Qatar Airways,"My in-flight entertainment system did not work at my seat for the 8h+ flight. I flagged this to the flight attendants which attempted to fix it to no avail, so I had no entertainment. I raised this with customer services upon my return home as in my opinion I did not receive the service I paid for, and I would expect a part refund however I was met with a half apology and fabrications. I was told that according to their reports I was offered an alternative seat which I refused.",I would expect a part refund
Qatar Airways,"Overall excellent experience, service, punctuality, onboarding experience. Excellent Variety of Food and beverages. Number one airline in all aspects.",Overall excellent experience
Qatar Airways,This has literally been one of my all time most pleasant flights. The food was top notch even for economy and the portions were super delicious. We were served restaurant level Thai and Vietnamese curries for dinner and lunch respectively. The infotainment was very advanced and you can easily use your phone to control it. The Wifi was also fast and reliable. I am definitely choosing Qatar Airways as my go-to option for all my Japan flights.,all time most pleasant flight
Qatar Airways,"After some pretty poor experiences this year using my preferred airline Singapore Airlines, I decided to try Qatar again after 6 years. Check in at Heathrow T4 quick and polite as was the boarding process. On board I found the A380 upper deck very good for economy, service from the crew was very good as was the food. Transfer in Doha quick and easy boarding for KUL done well and again seating felt roomy and comfortable even with the 3-4-3 seating on the 777, arrived KL a little early good flights. Returning check in polite unfortunately KLIA is a dreadful airport, possibly the worst in Asia with poor and uninterested staff along with poor facilities. That apart despite a 2 hour delay the flight to Doha was again pretty good, quick transfer in Doha all fine and the final flight to London was very nice. Bags recovered quickly, I will be using Qatar Airways in future.",I will be using Qatar Airways in future
Qatar Airways,"Very nice flights with Qatar Airways. Aircraft clean and well maintained, professional cabin crew, they never disappoint. The only thing to complain is that I passed through Hamad International several times and they never used fingers but only buses. This implies long wait and traffic jam due to the high number of buses. I imagine this is due to the strong increase of Qatar Airways destinations, but in any case it's a pity for such a beautiful airline! All in all, very good work Qatar.",Very nice flights with Qatar Airways
Qatar Airways,"Overall, it was okay. The food was pretty good, leg room was acceptable (wouldn't say the best though), customer service was good. The seats however, were really uncomfortable, they were very thin and had next to no padding which on a 14 hr flight, followed by a 7hr flight was brutal. We couldn't wait to get off. After this we flew, Cathay Pacific, ANA, and Jetstar, I've also flown Emirates, Air NZ, Qantas, LATAM, and Virgin, so I have a lot to compare it to. I'd only fly with them again if they were significantly cheaper then competitors.",“seats were really uncomfortable”
Qatar Airways,"I cover my checked bag with a cloth envelope to prevent it from scuffing. This flight plan involved a local carrier from Durban to Joburg and then Qatar to Doha then Chongqing. On my return flight, the plane was delayed for over an hour, due to mechanical issues in Doha. Consequently, by the time I landed in Joburg OR Tambo airport, passed through passport control, and picked up my baggage, my connecting flight was boarding. As OR Tambo re-check baggage was no longer operational, I had to rush to departures to check in my bag. The time was so time that the airline employee had to check with her supervisor to see if it could be loaded. I rushed through domestic security and was among the last passengers to board. When I landed in Durban, I had a chance to check my luggage and noticed damage. I complained at Durban airport and to Qatar. Qatar kept repeating that when I was in OR Tambo, I should have checked my luggage and filed a written damage report, which would have caused me to miss my plane.",I should have checked my luggage
Qatar Airways,Mahe - Doha. Allows 23kg + 7kg hand luggage per person. We had 1x large suitcase weighing 27kg and we had to repack twice even though we were under the permitted weight of 46kg. The lady and supervisor at check-in say there is no other way.  Mahé - Doha. Erlaubt 23kg + 7kg Handgepäck pro Person. Wir hatten 1x grossen Koffer mit 27kg und wir mussten 2x umpacken obwohl wir insgesamt unter den erlaubten 46kg lagen. Dame und Supervisor am Check-in sagen es geht nicht anderst.,we had to repack twice
Qatar Airways,"Seats are too narrow, no space for my legs. Transfer in Doha was complicated and unfriendly personnel. Boarding was chaotic. Will not fly Qatar Airways again.",Seats are too narrow
Qatar Airways,"From an epic experience to merely average. Have flown with QR many times long haul and Q suite is epic and unbeatable. However 4 recent trips to Istanbul in business class including the most recent reduce it to very average. The plane is a leased ex Cathay 777 still sporting the green flashes of Cathay, circa 11 years old and feels it. My major gripe is around service and food and beverage. On such a short circa 3.30 hour flight it was pedantic, why have stellar wine list if staff do not actively ask me if I want a refill let alone ask if I would like any at all. The food was sub par with a tough overcooked steak no coffee service no follow up no greeting and no goodbye.",The food was sub par
Qatar Airways,I was originally booked to fly on Cathay Pacific on 22 October however the flight Melbourne to Hong Kong was delayed by nine hours and I would not make the connection to Manchester. It took Cathay 6 hours to rebook me for the next available day of a direct flight HK to Manchester only for the same thing to happen again. On the second occasion I managed to get re-routed using Qatar Airways and this proved to be a welcome lucky break. Both flights were excellent with decent legroom and comfortable seats. Meals were better than expected and FA were both efficient and friendly. I managed to get some sleep on both flights. During the night FA made several runs through the cabin with drinks and snacks for those who were awake. The Doha to Manchester flight was full with only a few spare seats we left Doha late but that was not a airline problem but that of several large family groups of passengers who had not booked seats together but felt that numerous other passengers should be relocated to enable them to be accommodated in a seating arrangement they deemed acceptable. Flight attendants could have been more forceful in getting passengers into their allocated seats but it took a senior crew member to establish order so we could depart.,Both flights were excellent
Qatar Airways,"They charge an extra 100+ dollars for extra legroom without disclosing the fact that this area is used for bassinets, has extremely hard to reach Electric ports, and no TV or entertainment system unlike the other seats. There is no benefit to sitting here and in fact, as a result of sitting here, I got no sleep as I was sitting next to a newborn baby during a 13 hour flight. When I request a refund for the first seat I upgraded I was denied because I'd already flown the flight and used the seat. My grievances were ignored.",My grievances were ignored
Qatar Airways,"I have flown with them before and it used to be the best airlines where flight attendants were so warm and welcoming. Today I flew again with them and the all the interactions I had from check-in to my Flight attendant, everyone was just so passive aggressive. The seats are still nice with amazing space and amenities but the crew level has come down significantly.",crew level has come down
Qatar Airways,"This has been my first flight on Qatar in Y class since the onset of the pandemic and it was a huge disappointment. The catering was among the worst I had in a long time. They were not even half way through the cabin, when only one choice of meal was available. The minced beef with mashed potatoes were poor in taste and presentation. Bread rolls were  replaced by corn bread. No butter provided. The service was very slow and finally ended 3.5h after takeoff. The seats were narrow and uncomfortable. Considering the price I’ve paid, and what I got in return, I will not fly Qatar again until it returns to its old standards of service and catering.",seats were narrow and uncomfortable
Qatar Airways,"Great cabin, seats, crew and service excellent. Food could be improved and red wine shouldn't be served cold. WiFi should be included in the hefty business class fares.",Food could be improved
Qatar Airways,"Always excellent! Service, friendliness, comfort and quality all top. Pre-orderd food worked this time and i got a juice steak. Wine list excellent. The wines could be taken out and get room temperature after take off so when served not ics cold as now. WiFi should be free for the fairs charged in business class!",comfort and quality all top
Qatar Airways,"Once again an excelent trip with a world class airline. Top greeting, top service, great plane and seats. Food could be a bit better but wine list is excelent. Still think WiFi should be free in business class considering the fairs.",an excelent trip
Qatar Airways,"I flew on November 2nd Doha to Washington. The flight attendant Erica, who served our aisle was amazing in experience, smiling, and courteously served all types of customers with patience during the whole 14 hours flight.",flight attendant Erica was amazing
Qatar Airways,"I should state the inflight crews are nice and the aircraft are nice, however, when things go wrong, this airline is the worst I have ever experienced and does not care if customers face issues. I recently undertook a Business QSuite Trip from from London to Angola for the cost of circa £5000 and the biggest problem was as a result of an initial 6 hour delay due to problems with the aircraft, we missed the second Qatar Airways flight. As a result Qatar gave us no options but rerouted us down to Johannesburg and then up to Angola. This resulted in a 17 hour journey becoming 32hr, but the biggest problem was the Qatar booked some of this via an alternate airline organised by Qatar Airways, which I can only describe as ancient and worrying. This was meant to be a QSuite flight and was chosen so I could work en-route, arrive refreshed and get to work straight away. I wrote to Qatar Airways on my return and they paid out the initial compulsory delayed compensation and then gave a very generic Sorry, we take your feedback seriously. I have made no progress getting any sort of resolution, all you can get is the generic response). The entire AV system didn't work on one flight - I couldn't charge my laptop on one flight.  Overall, the very worst customer service ever experienced.",paid out the initial compulsory delayed compensation
Qatar Airways,"Riyadh to Doha 28-10 2023 on a full, late evening flight. Modern aircraft, A350-900Q. On time. Check-in became a hassle, as there were no transfer counters and I had to shift terminal by arriving with Saudia. I was forced to pay for a transit visa, 150 USD, despite I was never on landside and had only 1 hour transit time. This scrupulous exploitation is unacceptable, just taking advantage of people in rush. QR have no transfer desk nor transfer service in a big international airport to where they are flying several times per day. The good thing is that they, upon my request, at least reopened the check-in counter allowing me to check-in even after the minimum time of 60 minutes had elapsed. A lady behind me was also late, but disallowed to check-in, contrary to me. So, at least I got some premium for my hefty visa fee. Boarding was smooth, despite the flight was fully stuffed apart from an empty seat next to me. No alcohol served onboard with reference to a holy national day in Riyadh. Onboard, served a cold mezze meal, mine was still frozen. Only a single service round, and no service the last full hour prior to landing. Jetbridge provided in both ends. WiFi complicated but not working, a big waste of time trying to connect.",there were no transfer counters
Qatar Airways,"First time on Qatar using BA miles. I find it hard to understand why this airline is so appreciated. It’s no better than any other. Food is average with hot drinks not being served with breakfast due to the danger of spilling. Half the cabin crew are good and efficient, the other half are not. The A350 is good and comfortable with sufficient legroom, the 787 less so.",A350 is good and comfortable
Qatar Airways,"Nice and comfortable aircraft. Very good and friendly cabin staff service. Especially Saahil was an excellent air hostess. Very kind, helpful and accommodating.",friendly cabin staff service
Qatar Airways,"Doha-Kuwait 26 Oct. 2023 on a B777-300. Transit in Doha went well with some testing of their new gold/platinum lounges. The lounges and airport are overstaffed to my taste. To the extend they are about to become intrusive as they have too little to do. Transfer and revised seat selection was easy with new robot machines in the lounges. After the machine reads your passport, you get full overview and can print out new BP yourself. Impressive. Short evening flight, less than 1 hour duration. Huge aircraft, virtually full (300 pax?). Briefly on time. Gate boarding functioned well through division of passengers into 4 zones. I was treated with respect and served excellently. Food and drinks were informed online prior to travel, which had raised my expectations. And, it was all there: served a nice, cold Arabian mezze, nicely prepared and presented in a transparent design box separated in food sections with a spoon fixed elegantly across the sections. Softdrinks numerous, but surprisingly, cava “champagne” was served as well as wine, spirits, and beers. Two catering service rounds in 55 minutes is impressive. Staff competent, focused, polite, and extremely efficient. They gave me 3 seats due to my Privilege status at their FFP. Headset, blankets given. IFE and WiFi functioned well, was given a headset of good quality. Even if I would have been offered a free business class seat, I would not have changed it for my given 69G seat. I have a full appreciation and pleasant experience from this flight and cant fault anything. FA were well groomed, well rested, and in a transmitting, sparkling mood. I spoke Thai with a hostess, Ms. Pisolaya, who was outstanding. Qatar delivers top notch at times, particularly in the air. Well done QR!",Qatar delivers top notch at times
Qatar Airways,"The online check in was smooth, airport check in at Kathmandu was too slow, transit at Doha was smooth. Cabin crew on both the flights were friendly, attentive and caring. Meal ordered by me was all nice except the brunch served on Doha-Sao Paulo route. Seats on the Boeing 777 was bit congested and I felt cramped. Legroom too was not enough. Kathmandu - Doha was fine for seats. In flight entertainment was similar on both the flights. One hour complimentary WiFi was made available on Sao Paulo route, which could me made free in its entirety or for some more hours. Toilets were clean and good. Drinks served was good and extra drinks(tea, coffee and cola) were given to me on requests. Overall nice experience! 5 star",Overall nice experience
Qatar Airways,"Check in at BKK airport swift and friendly, lounge in BKK topnotch as usual, it’s my favorite lounge within the QR network. Food ex BKK great, service and comfort on the glorious A380 good as always. Transfer at Doha airport disappointing. The booked AlMaha transfer service did not show up at the gate (still waiting for a response from them since this happened for the third time this year!) Lounge very crowded with no chance to have a shower since the waiting time was over an hour and my transit was just 1.5h. Departure gate to Brussels was at one of the dreaded bus gates on the ground level. Chaotic unorganized boarding, with stressed and shouting gate agents. It’s simply no fun to go on a 30 minutes bus ride at 2 am in the morning. Most of my flights to Europe departed from a remote stand this year; that’s not what I expect from a world class airport. Flight to Brussels on a newish B789 with the new suite seating which I find too narrow and feels claustrophobic. Food was average ex Doha. Prior to my departure, I tried to book my meal ex Doha via the app, which did not work. I sent an email to customer service, but was told that that issue got nothing to do with them and therefore won’t be able to assist. No attempt was made to forward my issue to the IT department, or simply letting me pick my meal choice manually. I like flying Qatar, but the issues on the ground and it’s poor customer service are a big letdown and does not justify the premium airfare I’ve paid.",issues on the ground
Qatar Airways,"I took flight QR719 Doha to Seattle on 20th Oct. Neha the cabin crew was super nice during the whole journey. She was so friendly and warm and thoughtful, she made this long flight so much enjoyable, she was so attentive and always provided assistance.  She's really great, and I think it's really lucky for Qatar Airways to have her.",the cabin crew was super nice
Qatar Airways,Another great experience flying with Qatar Airways. Thank you to the crew members for your professionalism and kindness. I 100% recommend Qatar Airways.,Another great experience
Qatar Airways,"It was an absolutely lovely experience and the cabin crew were all very accommodating and excellent, I would like to personally thank Joseph and Tom for making our flight as comfortable as possible.",absolutely lovely experience
Qatar Airways,"Colombo to Doha - aircraft used was an Airbus A330. Qatar really need to either renovate or replace these, as the cabin on this one was really showing its age and was very tired, including a non-functioning seat next to me (was only able to be in full recline mode) and the dated, but very large in flight entertainment boxes that take up about one third of the available space beneath the seat in front for window seats and aisle seats in the central block of three seats. Toilets were a mess, IFE was limited compared to more modern Qatar aircraft; vastly inferior to the Qatar A380s, 777s etc. Thankfully this is a relatively short flight - wouldn't have wanted to do long haul that's for sure! Food was great, but since Covid, the in flight food service has been economised/simplified.",Toilets were a mess
Qatar Airways,"Doha to London Heathrow, 10th October 2023. 777ER which is always a bit cramped now that most airlines have squeezed in 10 abreast - noticeably less spacious than the Qatar A380 which is also 10 abreast. Cabin was clean and well-maintained and took a while for the air conditioning to kick in after engine start up, but when it did, wow it was cold! I normally like a cool cabin, as its possible to get warm with a blanket etc., but impossible to cool down if the cabin is too warm, but this was a bit far on the cool side, even with a blanket - maybe it was just me though? IFE is exceptional on these updated/more modern cabins and aircraft was kept clean throughout, including the washrooms. Despite many airlines simplifying food provision since Covid, the food was great, particularly the dessert which as well as being tasty, had a white chocolate in the middle, complete with Qatar branding! Bang on time and unlike every recent experience at Heathrow (my record being a 2.5 hour wait), bags arrived promptly. Could fault anything on this trip aside from the usual gripe about the cramped 10 abreast 777 cabin; great service, clean aircraft, great food, on time departure and arrival.",IFE is exceptional
Qatar Airways,"Flew from Singapore - Doha - Milan Return, out bound flights were great but Doha to Singapore was bad, After three hours of sleep, I went to put the Qsuite up and it broke, got up out of my seat and tried to fix it and there was no interaction from the crew until I rang the bell. Flight attendant came and said that it was my fault as my shoes were under the seat. Seat was then adjusted to a ridiculous position which was uncomfortable to sit in. Breakfast came and flight attendant tried to set up table but could not be done due to position of seat, left me sitting there before I complained to the cabin services manager. They try to fix it, they managed to manually position seat for me but only a few hours to landing. Qatar complaints was hopeless saying staff did everything possible and they blamed turbulence on the flight for not attending to seat first. Offered me 10,000 avios as compensation.","Offered me 10,000 avios as compensation"
Qatar Airways,"Wonderful experience spoiled by the ground staff at Doha. The flight from London Heathrow started out amazingly with the service at the premium check-in and passage through the security fast lane. The Qatar premium lounge at Heathrow is an oasis of calm and the food and drinks are excellent. Some of the staff lacked the polished 5 star touch. Service and comfort on our A380, although not the new q-suites, was excellent. Delicious food for breakfast and lunch. A stark contrast to the poor offerings on our outbound flight. The seats were comfortable. The Heathrow flight arrived at an A-Gate and the Dubai flight departed from C-gate. When we got to the C-gate we politely asked if there was a lounge close to the gate and received a very terse and rude no response from the Qatar Airways lady who was setting up the gate. Business/first passengers were made to hang around for 30 minutes whilst economy class passengers were bussed out to the plane. Not the service we paid for. Service on the flight to Dubai (A350) was good and the seats comfortable.",spoiled by the ground staff at Doha
Qatar Airways,Excellent experience let down by delays on the flight from Dubai which meant we didn't have chance to try the lounge in Doha and limited food options on the night flight to Gatwick. The food was little more than snacks and not the 5 star service we expected. The food was a stark contrast to the morning return journey from Heathrow. The food on that flight was amazing. The seats on the 777 to Doha were the old style 2-2-2 seats but that didn't matter on such a short flight. On the flight to Gatwick the seats were comfortable but sadly not the new qsuites.,Excellent experience let down by delays
Qatar Airways,"Brilliant, five star customer service provided by Namvkwla, Tae Vi and Calvin onboard QR962 on 2nd October. Nothing was to much for them. Food was okay, seat was fine onboard the new A350-100.",five star customer service
Qatar Airways,"It pains me to share this experience as I have always been a big fan of Qatar, having flown on it many times in my career while based in Washington DC and Geneva (business and first class). And, in fact, paid the extra money to upgrade to business class when I retired and returned to South Africa with my wife during the pandemic and it was expertly handled and a very satisfying, secure experience. Checked in at Schipol around noon on Tuesday 26 September travelling QR0274 to Doha, then QR1369 to Cape Town on Wednesday 27 September. Checked in three bags, two were received, and one was not. Reported at CPT on arrival on 27 September and a property irregularity report completed with appropriate supporting information including pics. Since then it has been a nightmare of correspondence and communication with various people in CPT, DOHA and AMS. All to NO avail. No one seems to have the capability, willingness or interest in helping a customer retrieve their missing bag containing valued personal possessions, including our family Holy Bible which is irreplaceable. Apparently the missing bag apparently was traced in AMS and was meant to be loaded on QR0274/29 September to be delivered in CPT on QR1369/30 September. Nothing arrived and there seems to be complete confusion between CPT and Qatar representatives in Doha and AMS. It seems AMS are not responding but I find it hard to believe that Qatar would not physically investigate what is going on at AMS with their baggage handlers, whom I believe are Swissport. I tried Swissport and the Station Manager in AMS but they don't answer their phones. I keep being assured that the bag is on the next flight but nothing. It is now a week since the missing bag was traced and it is just endless communication with people who want nothing to do with the problem and passing the blame to someone else. No one is willing to show any initiative or take accountability.",missing bag apparently was traced in AMS
Qatar Airways,"Although it was very early morning, things went fairly smooth. I was moved further up as they needed my seat for someone with medical problems which I was totally ok with. However the seat 19D armrest was falling apart. Food was very nice, and had a nice sleep. Perhaps on those early morning flights would be nice to have a choice (sticker) saying whether I want to be woken up for food or whether I want to be left sleeping. In terms of inflight entertainment it would be nice to be able to watch Rugby World cup",things went fairly smooth
Qatar Airways,"The seats felt like auditorium seating, Ok for 20 minutes but leave your bottom numb for anything longer. The seating was simply just too small and packed in and the cushioning was basically non existent. Sitting on the isle I was kicked, bumped and stood on nearly every time a staff member came past. This was supposedly in a seat that gave me more leg room and I paid extra for.",seating was simply just too small
Qatar Airways,"I am writing to thank Qatar Airways for exceptional service during my flight from Washington to Kathmanda via Doha.  All flight attendants were welcoming, warm, and professional during both of my flights and provided first-class service. I have to say that Qatar Airways are simply the best airline in the world. Thank you very much.",exceptional service
Qatar Airways,"At the online check-in when they give me the availability to choose a seat for free on the middle or the aisle side on my return ticket, both ways. If I wanted to have the window side I had to pay an extra fee. The most disappointing was the food, we had 2 options chicken rice and braised beef when they come to me they didn't have beef anymore, so I  had to take the chicken biryani. No butter or cheese was served.  On the online check-in counter in Muscat i waited more than 25 minutes because one family had immigration issues, since only 1 counter was available.",most disappointing was the food
Qatar Airways,"I booked to fly Qsuite business from Jakarta to Athens return. On checking in at Jakarta International airport we had to stand and wait for an hour.  When I raised my concern with the staff, they said it was because they have three flights departing at that time.  The lounge was the Garuda Business lounge that was really awful. The only alcoholic beverages available were unpalatable and inferior products.  The ghastly food offering was substandard and inedible. The lounge was cramped, hot and overcrowded. We left the lounge and used the general access / food court section and bought a decent glass of wine and better food. Four weeks before my return flight, Qatar emailed me to say I can not return from Doha to Jakarta in Qsuite because they changed aircraft to one without Q Suite. If If I still want to fly Qsuite, I must catch an alternative flight 7 hours later and wait 9 hours in Doha rather than about 2. Their rules state that I am unable to enter the Doha business lounge until a few hours before my flight, so the rest of the time, I would be locked out of the lounge. As to their email apology to me for moving my fight to a plane without Q Suite, they said I could choose my own seat in the new plane to get the seat of my choice. I tried. And they will not allow me to book my seat until 48 hours before the flight.",Garuda Business lounge that was really awful
Qatar Airways,"We flew from Vienna to Muscat via Doha. The aircraft in the 1st leg was Airbus 320, an old aircraft, seats with hardly any space between the rows. The screen was slow with poor resolution. The inflight program was very limited.  There were only 2 toilets for the economy cabin resulting in a long queue post-lunch. How can they use a small aircraft for an almost 5 hour 15 mins flight. A320 may be appropriate for a short flight but definitely not for this flight.",they use a small aircraft
Qatar Airways,"The flight from Bangkok to Doha was on the A380-800. The flight from Doha to Vienna was on an Airbus A320. Both flights were on time and the staff on both flights were very professional and friendly. The food options were above average, and there was a good choice of drink options. I did notice that the entertainment system seemed to have a lot less choice of content than when I last flew Qatar Airways, and the leg room felt a little tighter. Arriving to Doha around 11:00 pm meant a huge crowd waiting to get through security. Doha airport is OK. The flight back to Europe meant taking a bus to the plane and this was a bit of a pain. Both flights were completely full. At Bangkok, I asked at the check in counter whether it was a full flight and the guy behind the desk said that it was overbooked. I guess the remaining passengers got to fly on the next Qatar flight to Doha, which left just an hour and a half after my flight. T I will still fly Qatar Airways and I will still recommend them.",the leg room felt a little tighter
Qatar Airways,"Flight hostesses didn't acknowledge or greet me as I walked to get seated. There are 2-3 hostesses standing by their assigned section who don't acknowledge or greet you, and if they do it's forced and fake. They give juice/water and if you return it when they come to collect it and you say thank you they didn't acknowledge.",didn't acknowledge or greet me
Qatar Airways,"Please note that this review is meant solely for the Qatar Airways ground staff. The scores given for seat comfort and cabin staff service are based on previous flights, for reasons given below. We had to cancel our trip due to a family emergency, while we were already in the departure lounge, literally an hour before boarding. We were absolutely distraught because of worry and needed guidance badly for what to do. After exiting the departure lounge and returning to the Qatar Airways check-in counter, one of the staff immediately came to our aid. We had noticed him earlier during check-in attending to passengers queuing for the counters and providing labels for our bags. Not only did he listen patiently to our situation, he also gave clear instructions on how to retrieve our checked-in luggage, as well as when and whom to call in order to manage our flight booking. His calm and sure directions, as well as assistance from other counter staff, helped us tremendously in dealing with the situation. Furthermore, the office that we called regarding our booking attended to our needs very professionally. She explained what we needed to do clearly and repeated patiently when asked to.",helped us tremendously
Qatar Airways,"The First Class lounge in Doha is amazing and then we went on a VIP bus to the plane which actually took longer than the flight. The front cabin on the plane which they called First it wouldn’t qualify for even a C class in Europe.  The take off and landing were immaculate, the pilot was amazing and food was ok. That is all I can say about a 55 minute flight.",“First Class lounge in Doha is amazing”
Qatar Airways,"Check in at AUH fast, Al Dhabi contract Lounge average in terms of offerings and service. Flight from Abu Dhabi to Doha uneventful with good service and decent snack. Oryx One Play entertainment system again not working throughout the flight. No contact gate in Doha with a long 20 min bus ride from a remote stand. Qatar Platinum Lounge South crowded, but fast service and good offerings. 2nd leg to BKK aircraft change from A380 to B773 without being informed. Random seat assigned. Luckily realized this some time before and changed to a decent seat. Boarding organized and from a contact gate. Flight service good, with average catering. WIFI not working.",fast service and good offerings
Qatar Airways,"July 2023. Family of 5 with 3 children, pre-booked extra leg room seats and so that we could be together. Our seats were reallocated to a group as we transited through Doha airport. We ended up with seats spread across the entire the aircraft, nowhere near each other. Our 13 year old who’s afraid of flying was sick with the stress caused, and to us as parents worried that if something happened there was no way we could have taken care of our 3 children. Total lack of interest, no customer care, no customer service, no attempt to improve the situation, then lies and fabrication of reasons when we complained at the gate, onboard and afterwards to their customer care team. First they claimed the aircraft had been changed, then that our seats were changed for operational reasons, and then best of all claiming we had missed our flight and had been put on a different plane. Because we complained, we never got a refund for the extra leg room seats.",we never got a refund
Qatar Airways,"Qatar Airways has good service on board and the seats are quite comfortable. The airport is also nice to explore. I flew twice now with Qatar but this time we had a delay already in Entebbe of 3 hours then lost the connection flight and had to wait 8 hours in Doha. I asked for a hotel room or a  food voucher or anything. We were forced to wait around and sleep in lounge chairs. This was not acceptable and for a waiting time, lost hotel and lost day in Vienna I expected at least an apology.",lost the connection flight
Qatar Airways,The service was amazing. All the time the cabin crew was walking around with drinks and snacks. During the flight I had some problems with my back (sport injuries)and I was walking in the plane to stretch my feet. A cabin crew member came to me and checked if everything is fine and If she could bring me something. She brought me some water and we talked about daily life. She was very kind and at the end even gave me child present for my children at home.  She went the extra mile. Thank you Premkamol. See you hopefully soon again.,The service was amazing
Qatar Airways,"Check in at Bangkok airport friendly and efficient. Even Qatars Platinum members are not allowed to use their own lounge in BKK. Their contract Miracle lounge was very average to say the least and does not deserve the name. Boarding was well organized. Cabin crew was friendly and efficient throughout the flight. Food was a big letdown, with no more butter for breakfast, no pepper and salt or a small spoon for the dessert or stirring the coffee. The main meal was disappointing in appearance and taste. Internet worked for just 20 min after reaching cruising altitude. Al Maha transfer service worked well this time after the hostess did not show up twice at the aircraft earlier this year. Platinum lounge was great. The short second leg of the trip was uneventful; the virtual entertainment system (their new 738 do not have private screens) did not work throughout the flight. Overall very average flights.",very average flights
Qatar Airways,"First time traveling with Qatar Airways, from Auckland NZ to Milan return via Doha. Staff and aircraft were fantastic! Food and service no 1. Lay flat bed in business class probably the best I've been on. I recommend using Qatar Airways to others",Staff and aircraft were fantastic
Qatar Airways,"I paid $88 USD extra for an exit row seat with extra leg room, based on the Qatar Airways seat map during online purchase. But my seat was not in an exit row. I assumed that the aircraft had been changed at the last minute and that the airline would refund the fee. After complaining to Qatar Airways twice, they denied that there was anything wrong.",my seat was not in an exit row
Qatar Airways,"Brilliant service as always, clean and modern aircraft. Service outstanding, personal greeting and recognition by onboard crew probably because I have gold status, was not expecting this and it pleasantly blew me away that they offered this personal touch. I booked Al Maha services and was really impressed. Staff go out of their way to make you feel welcome and comfortable, cannot fault a single cabin crew member. Food always of a high standard. Hamad International airport amongst best in the world. Lounges brilliant. I will likely always choose Qatar even though a direct route to certain destinations may be more convenient and cheaper.",Brilliant service as always
Qatar Airways,"We booked 2 business seats to Europe and we had to pay to choose our seats. I paid $989.80 to select seats. We were supposed to be on Qsuites, one of the reasons we booked with Qatar. On the First leg from Athens to Doha they changed our plane to one that didn't have Qsuites. The seats they allocated us were at the rear on the business cabin, very noisy. As we didn't get the seats we paid for I thought they would offer us a refund for the money we paid to select seats . When we got home I waited for a few days and when I didn't hear from them I contacted them via email. They refused to compensate for the downgrade from Qsuites and they wanted me to sign an Indemnity and Waiver of Liability Form to refund the money I paid for a service they didn't supply. They should refund the fee they charged for seat allocation on this leg.",changed our plane to one that didn't have Qsuites
Qatar Airways,"I upgraded to Business Class (Q-Suites) on outbound flights, and flew Economy Class on the return. All flights were excellent. Business Class was phenomenal: the service, attention to detail, quality and selection food and wine, and the hard products. I loved the fact that on the two outbound legs, there were different wine lists, so I got to try a wide selection of 4 Champagnes and numerous high-quality wines. Cabin crew were always incredibly attentive, responsive, and friendly. On the return, in Economy Class, I also had a two very good flights. Despite only being a Silver member, I was still personally welcomed aboard, and given the opportunity to select my desired meals before meal service. The selection of wine was decent, and the food was fine. Service was always friendly, polite and professional. I really enjoy Qatar - and even though Business and Economy are incomparable, they offer highly polished, professional service in both classes, and goodt IFE, food, and comfort.","highly polished, professional service"
Qatar Airways,Cabin staff service: Inflight staff is very inexperienced or there is not enough staff. Most of the passengers have complained about inflight service. They were not able complete the food service also on time. Food : For the long term flight food also very bad. Most of the people are not eating some particular items. May be airline can identify this item and remove this item from the menu.,not able complete the food service
Qatar Airways,"Fantastic service, professional staff. Would definitely fly with Qatar again. Drink and meal service was amazing. Qatar allow you to dine when you want and continuously top up drinks. You are able to pick what you like from the menu when you want. The private suites are amazing. This is truly a 5 star airline.",This is truly a 5 star airline
Qatar Airways,Yet another fantastic experience with Qatar Airways. Check in service at Heathrow was an absolute pleasure. Services onboard QR 010 on 7th September provided by cabin crew was second to none. They were a fantastic cabin crew and was absolute pleasure flying with them. Thank you very much.,another fantastic experience
Qatar Airways,Staff good. Food ok. Seat comfort on 787 absolute zero. I'm 6ft 4 . No room for me at all and the person in front trying to push the seat back to recline. You can pay for a reserved seat at nearly £100 per flight. Adverts when you try to watch movies.,Seat comfort on 787 absolute zero
Qatar Airways,"I have Gold status in the loyalty program. After each trip, I send a request via their website to issue an invoice. Customer service ignores my requests. I have been waiting for some invoices for more than a year. The call center is helpless and they say they only send escalations to the head office. The trip itself is, of course, great, but the customer service is at a dramatic level and makes me feel frustrated and helpless.",waiting for some invoices for more than a year
Qatar Airways,"The first leg of this flight was on the A380 and the second was on a Boeing 787. The A380 was full booked and it’s a remarkable aircraft. Food was terrible on both flights. On the second flight I was starving and was disappointed when all I was given as my first meal was a sandwich. Then the breakfast was inedible. The crew on the flight didn’t seem to get on with each other. Rather unprofessional. Wi-Fi didn’t work. In flight entertainment is superb, credit where credit is due. Wasn’t impressed with Qatar on my last couple of flights.",Food was terrible
Qatar Airways,"I found these two flights quite difficult from a personal standard. The first leg was at 8am, and I was wide awake for and couldn’t rest. The second flight I tried to get some rest but I couldn’t. The food on these flights was really tasty. Especially the Edinburgh to Doha leg. The in flight entertainment was vast and very good. I had checked in online and went straight to security with my E boarding pass, but it didn’t work at security. They let me through then the airline printed me a hard copy at the gate.",food on these flights was really tasty
Qatar Airways,"London to Doha was average. Food quality has gone down and entertainment was pretty average with no new movies. Doha to Kochi was with a 'no-frill' airline Indigo from Doha to Kochi. This was absolutely horrible, seats were thin and very uncomfortable, no entertainment, my food was absolutely horrible and staff could not care less. Qatar trying to make a profit by providing customers with a no-frill service is unbelievable and not acceptable. After landing in Doha, we had to take a 25 minute bus ride from the plane to the airport.",Indigo was absolutely horrible
Qatar Airways,"Qatar Airways is one of the most professional airlines. I was very ill on flight, the steward called doctor who allowed medication to be given to help me, then exceptional service once arrived in Doha. I was taken to lounge to shower and escorted to a resting area as I was travelling alone. I highly recommend Qatar Airways. I felt that I was in very safe hands.",I highly recommend Qatar Airways
Qatar Airways,"Qatar Airways is undoubtedly the best airline. From booking my tickets on line to online checkin, airport services, in flight comfort, cabin crew, transfer at Doha, everything was just amazing. Although tickets were comparatively expensive however services were value to money.",everything was just amazing
Qatar Airways,I travelled from Geneva to Qatar and Qatar to Colombo using Qatar airways. I was pleasantly surprised to see the concern of the staff regarding the passengers issues. We made a mistake when we checked in to the Geneva airport. We did a hassle free online check in including user friendly seat reservations which helped us to identify seats to our liking and received the boarding pass immediately. However we were confused at the airport as it was our first journey through Geneva airport and did not attend to luggage. At the boarding gate only we realized that we were carrying huge bags with us. When we explained our situation to the Qatar air ways staff they calmly accepted the challenge and attended to our needs immediately without causing us any pain. We are grateful to all the ground staff and crew members at the gate 56 at 16.10 on the 2nd September for their concern. Even while serving us cabin crew members were polite to check on us to make sure that everything regarding our bags is OK. This shows their genuine interest in the well being of the passengers which they may have gained through exemplary training or/and air line may be selecting the ideal people having humanely qualities. The service we received throughout was exceptional. Thank you Qatar airways.,service throughout was exceptional
Qatar Airways,"Although I booked an aisle seat, I was given a middle seat at check-in without anyone mentioning the change, so I had the surprise when I boarded the plane. The flight attendants were very nice and apologetic and tried to find a solution but since the flight was full there wasn't much they could do. I am aware that sometimes there is a last minute change of aircraft and all the seats are changed, but I believe this was not one of these situations because my neighbours on either had the seat they had booked even before I booked mine. I strongly suspect that this happened when I upgraded my return flight to business class, a glitch in the system cleared my seat selection for the outbound journey. I wrote to Qatar Airways about it, and they replied that they are free to change seats at any time, including after boarding. There wasn't enough food, 2 meals and one sandwich, and my vegetarian ovo-lacto meal was a vegan meal. There also seemed to be some confusion among the staff, a couple of times they served me a regular meal and then took it away to give me the special meal. The flights were on time, IFE was good and the flight attendants were very nice.",I was given a middle seat
Qatar Airways,"The plane from Bangkok to Doha was decent enough but the Boeing 777-300ER from Doha to LHR was shocking. Mould on the ceiling and interior, badly cleaned surfaces.  Will not use them again in the future unless they improve. The airport was decent enough. I'm giving them a score this high because of the onboard staff who did the best they could.",Will not use them again
Qatar Airways,London to Doha was delayed two hours but Qatar Airways failed to inform the passengers about this and not to wake up at 4AM and get to the airport. The onboard the personal service was fantastic especially Maria and Stephanie they really took care of the passengers. The IFE was not working on my seat 1A and WI-FI was patchy but it was nice to experience the Qatar Airways A380 again.,the personal service was fantastic
Qatar Airways,"I asked for a low salt menu, instead of actual food and desserts I got mostly small portions of vegetables (cucumber, tomato) and fruits. I don't think chocolate cakes or tiramisu have salt in them and excluding them from my menu was a turn off. Also the portions of my food were very little.",I asked for a low salt menu
Qatar Airways,I and my wife had Business Class tickets. I was offered an upgrade in the app on checkin for my 3 daughters. After paying for it I realised that the upgrade was only for the segment from Doha to Zurich.  I therefore requested either an upgrade for the whole trip or a refund of the amount paid and return to economy. Customer service (center not managed by Qatar) answered that I was wrong and I should have read the terms and conditions. Refused any of the two options.  In Doha we try and access the Business Class lounge. No access for my children as the tickets were upgraded and not full Business class. Qatar Airways website places the cost of access to the lounge at 450dr 59% off for children. No mention of the fact that an age restriction applies to minors between 12 and 17 which are not considered children. All these rules applied in a very strict manner with no flexibility.,upgrade was only for the segment
Qatar Airways,"Check in at Zurich airport friendly and swift. Prime Class lounge was rather underwhelming with poor breakfast choices, but nice outdoor seating. Flight to Doha was downgraded from Qsuite to normal seating quiet some time ago. Flight to Doha was very good with great catering and good service. Arrival in Doha at a remote stand. The Al Safwa lounge food has improved. Flight from Doha to BKK by the all Thai cabin crew was great, catering not as good as the previous flight.  After all, reasonably ok flights, but nothing special considering what I paid for.",Al Safwa lounge food has improved
Qatar Airways,"I had an upgrade offer for two persons for Business Class for booth flight sections in my app. After paying I got the message that it was not possible. I thought it was a bug, so I updated my APP content and got the upgrade offer again. I paid again and received the information a second time that it was not possible, after booking on my credit card. These amounts were blocked not just once, but twice each. 8,272 EUR from Qatar Airways were blocked on my card for a whole day. At the business check-in counter, no one could understand what had happened. Only reaction was please write a mail to Qatar Airways.  I have never experienced such bad service. In the flight from Doha the climate was not working. After more than an hour of waiting in unbearable temperatures on the plane, a glass of water was served without a word of apology why it was so hot on the plane. After about 3 hours the temperatures become somewhat bearable. Writing an E-Mail on August 4th to Qatar was more then useless. Qatar Airway told me it was a due a system error. Nothing about the very bad untrained Service on the ground and in the Air. As a Frequent Flyer you get a welcome on board but no Service to solve Problems.",experienced such bad service
Qatar Airways,"This review highlights the exemplary service of the Doha-JFK flight QR 701 aircrew on 19th August 2023. Qatar Airways is known for its excellent service in general, but some flight crew do a much better job than others. I wish to mention flight attendant Ms. Amanat specifically for her outstanding service to me and my fellow passengers during our flight. She was always patient, kind, and willing to cater to passenger requests during the flight. She never lost her smile and showed a genuine effort to make our travel comfortable.",highlights the exemplary service
Qatar Airways,"Milan to Windhoek via Doha return with A350-900 from/to Milan and B788 to/from Windohek. Excellent service provided as usual. Crew always very good to top notch depending on the route. Airplanes always new an well maintained. The seat was amazingly comfortable, much better than QSuite that feels a little claustrophobic. PJ's handed out even into a day flight, the F/A also gave to me an extra one for the following leg. The food was very fresh and tasty. The transit in Doha was also smooth, even though if your flight is parked not at the finger you may have a little time to spend on the bus to the terminal. Priority lanes for security work very well and the staff always with a smile. The business class lounge Al Mourjan was full of staff and very helpful. The buffet restaurant is a nice touch with plenty of choice. QR will be my first choice from Italy to UAE, much better than EK. QR staff really knows how to engage with their customers in a warm and authentic manner to make you feel welcome and valuable.",Excellent service provided
Qatar Airways,"Most disappointing flight I've had for several years. Baggage damaged and Qatar refuted saying I left it too late and already went through customs. In fact I had gone straight from the carousel to the baggage claim. Both my meals were inedible. Power supply for laptop was old and plug kept falling out. We booked a month early and checked in early but got horrible centre seats. The problem was the online check in wouldn't let me change them. I had to phone and was told I had to pay $100 to change the seat. At checkin I tried again but first leg was Finnair and they couldn't change the seat. Then we tried when we got to Doha, before security and there was a long queue of other people also trying the same - we were 30 minutes in the queue and they said they couldn't change but someone else said to try at customer service. There was another long queue and this time they said there were no spare seats available any more. Was promised an hour of Wi-Fi as a prestige member but every time I tried it said satellite not available.",Both my meals were inedible
Qatar Airways,"Overall, the flight was pleasant. Flying with Qsuite from Jakarta to Doha was exceptional. The cabin crew was friendly, helping a lot, always checking with us if we need help. The Food taste is just amazing for my 2 meals. The Entertainment also updated and had a lot choice for a long trip. Just like mini apartment when flying in Qsuite. Unfortunately, from Doha to PHL, they changed that into regular Business Class in 2-2-2 Configurations. The services are still great for 13 hours flight.",Qsuite was exceptional
Qatar Airways,Excellent service as always by Qatar - cabin crew were very solicitous at all times. The meals were ample and served by the friendliest and hardest working staff I've seen. I get spoiled by QA - I don't want to fly with anyone else!,Excellent service as always
Qatar Airways,"Hanoi - Doha - Johannesburg 13-14 August 2023 on Boeing 787-9 / A350-9, respectively. On time. Flew on QR award tickets; selected my favourite seats free due to Frequent Flyer status. Quick check ins. Lounge in Hanoi spacious and good. Onboard, menu had 3 choices of hot meal, all announced 10 days prior to departure on QRs homepage. Transfer in Doha smooth with lounge access (Gold Lounge Gate C14). The flights were faultless and excellent for economy class. FAs were energetic, well rested, groomed, and in a sparkling mood. Drinks were generously served throughout the flights, up to 3 drinks per person per round. Food was good with 3 hot options on each sector, though small portions. Further were sandwiches and snacks served and/or obtainable on request. Both flights were de facto full; this challenges were handled well by the crew who knew how to focus without panicking. IFE worked well with on touch screens, huge supply of movies. Amenity kit and kids toys were given to all who wanted. Decent wines for economy: sparkling was a decent French crémant: Veuve Ambal Chardonnay/Aligoté (30 usd/bottle). White wine was acceptable: Frontera Chardonnay 2022, Chile. Red wine was very good: Maison Robert Olivier Syrah, France. Sodas and beer brands were substandard as usual: the cheapest industrial stuff, sells for max. 1-2 USD/can. Was recognised and further pampered as elite frequent flyer of QR. Only down fall are the very conservative and conform food offerings and the tedious bus-gating in Doha, depriving passengers any premium feeling. Luggage failed to be loaded in Hanoi depriving me comfort on the subsequent numerous flights. Could only file PIR-report at final destination of my entire travel, in Copenhagen. Luggage still not recovered, but I trust it will come soon. Will fly QR again, however.",tedious bus-gating in Doha
Qatar Airways,"Maputo to Denpasar via Doha was very disappointing.  Qatar Airways was very average, and on occasions below average, on these flights. Chairs were not great, especially the entertainment console under the chair in front of you.  The internet was the worst I've experienced, and the most expensive. Food was okay, nothing exceptional. Unfortunately no Qatar any more for me and it's confirmed that the 787 is not my plane. The A350 is so much quieter and more comfortable",The internet was the worst
Qatar Airways,A delay of 90 minutes.  I still managed to arrive in time for my connection but we had barely time to rest in Doha. 90 minutes transit time to get across the terminal to the next gate instead of 3 hours transit.,delay of 90 minutes
Qatar Airways,My family and I flew this airline and this Boeing 787 from Rome - Denpasar was complete hell. This is a small aircraft for that distance travelled (10.5 hours) seating is 3x3x3 and aisles are small. There is no chance of movement once boarded as there is a lot of time taken up by trollies in the aisle.,Boeing 787 is a small aircraft
Qatar Airways,We flew from Jakarta to Doha on business class but were denied lounge access because it was an upgrade. Whats the point of attracting customers if they have to sit in the airport or a restaurant.,were denied lounge access
Qatar Airways,"Absolutely memorable trip, outstanding. Our first flight to Doha had new business class seats - very good ones. Long haul was in Q-suite, an amazing experience. They call it 1st class in business and I confirm it. Service was immaculate. Flight was in time and we arrived earlier than planned to Singapore. Choice of meal and drinks are very good. Staff treated us like kings. There were new releases of movies and cartoons and particularly Sing 2. We had Al Maha VIP platinum service in Doha and I strongly recommend to have it to everyone since Doha is huge airport. The lounges were fantastic. Both in Singapore and in Doha. Our luggage was in good order.",Absolutely memorable trip
Qatar Airways,The crew were very helpful and extremely supportive. The entertainment screens have a lot of options. Comfortable chairs even for long trips in economy class. Food was amazing.,Food was amazing
Qatar Airways,"There was an issue with our seats as we were given regular seats instead of the extra legroom seats we booked. I raised the issue with the staff and we were relocated to the correct seats. Service on board was good, special thanks to Ruan who was the most friendly staff member.",Service on board was good
Qatar Airways,"On this trip, my outbound flight from Manchester was delayed by a passenger becoming ill. Whilst I sympathise with a passenger, falling ill, of course, a speedier decision would've saved me from missing connections, which we inevitably did. We sat on the plane for an hour and 45 minutes, whilst it seemed the captain dithered over whether or not to offload the passenger. He did not offload them. Upon arrival in Doha, 15 minutes after my connection had already departed, I was handed a new ticket for a flight which left at 02:25, 7.5 hours later with no apology for the inconvenience caused. There was a flight leaving for Jakarta at 8 pm via Singapore, but I was not offered that option. There was another flight leaving at 08:25 the next morning which would have suited me best, but I was not offered that choice either. I asked if I could go into a hotel for the night to rest properly before taking the 08:25 flight in the morning. They advised me that because my delay was 'less than eight hours' (it was 7.5 hours.) I was not entitled to a hotel. The business lounge in Qatar is not designed for lengthy waits so I asked if I might enter the first-class lounge at least for the duration of my wait given that the delay was the fault of the airline. I was refused because I am 'not a member' When eventually we finally left Doha on that 02:25 flight, I was exhausted and my seat was next to the galley where I heard the crew banging, talking and generally being noisy. I have never experienced such a disengaged crew as this one.

Qatar Airways,"-I was informed three month ago that all 3 sectors of my itinerary were downgraded to the old seating. I was able to change my flights back to Qsuites by changing flights, but had to accept a 12h layover at Doha airport. Since I can sleep on overnight flights in the Qsuite only, I accepted the offer. Unfortunately both flights were downgraded again, I was informed about the Bangkok to Doha sector 3 days ago, and about the Doha to Zurich sector just 6h before the departure of the flight.  I was up to now willing to pay more, since Qsuites are in high demand and rates were this time around €350 higher than other configuration. When I requested compensation for the previous flights, since I paid a premium for those Qsuite bookings too, I received 2 identical pre-written standard responses saying that they were not willing to compensate, not even with some Qmiles. I am really upset, since the Qsuites are promoted everywhere on the booking app, but what’s the point of booking a Qsuite if I don get it! One of the mentioned flights was my 100th on Qatar, about 70% in Business class, but it never happened that there was a aircraft change from an old configuration to Qsuite, only the other way round. On a lighter note, the flights were outstanding, esp. the Bangkok to Doha sector (QR839) with great food and service. I want to thank especially the wonderful and hard working Purser and her team. I can’t really recommend Qatar at this point, since the hardware problems are getting from bad to worse.",downgraded to the old seating
Qatar Airways,"Firstly, my flight from DUB to DOH was delayed for over 1.5 hours, causing me to miss my connecting flight to DXB. Upon arriving in DOH, I was informed that I would have to wait 5 hours for the next available flight. I sought reassurance that my luggage would be taken care of and transferred to the new flight. I was assured that it would be, but to my dismay, the new connection flight was also delayed by an hour, extending my layover to a 6 hours. I spent an additional 2 hours waiting in a queue to inquire about the whereabouts of my luggage, to discover that it had never left DOH. I was told it would be delivered to my accommodation by morning, yet to this day, it has not arrived, leaving me without essential items. The level of service has left me utterly disgusted.",wait 5 hours for the next available flight
Qatar Airways,"Qatar airways is the best airline. As a passenger that requires special assistance, i was assisted in every good way possible. Coming to UK last year September was superb and going back to Nigeria was superb with their customer services. Hanna service at the check-in area was professional and top-notch with contagious smile on her smile. Staff neatly clothed with super smiles on there faces and always ready to assist. I will definitely use Qatar Airways. Thank You.",Qatar airways is the best airline
Qatar Airways,"We have been using Qatar Airways for over 10 years now without any issues. This time when we booked in their website we found Qatar using another airline called Indigo (cheap no-frill airline) for the Doha-Kochi route. We were absolutely shocked to see the service provided by both Qatar & Indigo. Quality of food has gone down in Qatar, no new entertainment / movies & Indigo Airlines was a disaster (no water provided, no screens for entertainment, rude staff etc).",cheap and no-frill experience
Qatar Airways,"It's good to note that Qatar Airways open its check in counter 5 1/2 hours before departure! Good thing I went to NAIA cause I thought its going to rain and it might cause traffic! Started forming our lines at 5:30pm and counters open exactly 5:50pm fir the 11:20pm flight. Check in process was quiet slow, despite my Silver Status I left the counter at 6:40pm. Understandably only two counters were open since the other check in staff are assisting the 6:35pm departure. Anyway, though it was slow but OK since the clerk was super nice and offered me a complimentary lounge pass! The plane departed around 15 minutes later than published but was able to overcome and arrived earlier in Doha! Was a very smooth landing and the crew were all warm! Food served dinner and breakfast were both sumptuous and delicious! I was seated on a window seat and was quiet cramped because the guy beside me was humungous. Arrival in Doha was as expected very warm and pleasant, security check was fast and quick! A separate lounge for Silver members were provided, and was surprised of its huge size, very comfortable, good food, very clean comfort rooms! Went to the gate early as it was quiet far but thanks to the sky train, I was at my gate in seconds! Fortunately, I was upgraded to Business Class on the second leg of the journey! It was a very pleasant experience considering the 13 hours flight to Montreal! Everything went perfectly well! The very comfortable Q Suite, the award winning Catering and the Best Crew Services contributed to an overall pleasant experience! Thanks to Anna and Dale for taking care of me plus their very beautiful Supervisor which I wasn't able to get the name! Thank you Qatar Airways for the free upgrade and thank you for the best service provided!",best service provided
Qatar Airways,"First time flying Qatar Airways and definitely the last time. Seats were great and staff was also great and that is the only positive thing about the flight. But the IFE system did not work on my flight. The Ground staff was bad in New York, but ok in Doha. Flight was delayed 30 mins because of technical issues without further information.",IFE system did not work
Qatar Airways,"Thank you Qatar Airways Due to the nature of employment, I fly on regularly with long distance flights since 2000. During 2020 with the COVID outbreak, my then carrier of choice stopped flights to and from Johannesburg, South Africa. Qatar Airways was the first airline that resumed flights from South Africa and by times the flights were less than 10% full, but Qatar kept on flying and that bought my loyalty. In addition to the above, why do I continue with Qatar Airways? Flights always on time (very important for me!) ground and flight personnel professional and friendly, Doha transit very quick and efficient even with numerous flights disembarking, providing socks, eye masks and toothpaste kits for even Economy class, food and drinks served of good quality, and lastly - flight schedules work out perfect for me.",Flights always on time
Qatar Airways,"Staff were unfriendly, did not smile and made me feel unwelcome. During service it looked unorganised and on our second flight it took 2.5hrs before a drink or meal was offered. Received a meal and saying thank you to the hostess who did not even acknowledge it. D0 not understand how they say the tomato juice is finished 2hrs into the 9hrs flight and they need to go see if business class has.  On our last flight they loaded us into a bus for departure in Doha. We had to stand in it for 30min at the gate before it moved anywhere and to top it off we had to board a hot plane sitting for 30min before taxing and any form of cold air.",made me feel unwelcome
Qatar Airways,"I would like to say a big Thank you to Qatar Airways cabin crew for a job well done on the 7 & 8th of July, You guys know what you are doing, I fell sick on the plane and you attended to me in a a Godly way, even the clinic staff I was taken to when we landed, I salute you all, may you all be blessed in special ways for me by God. Qatar Airways is the best way to go, and I would recommend it anytime to anyone...100 percent",Qatar Airways is the best way to go
Qatar Airways,The check-in was smooth and the crew was pleasant and the food was good. The seat was uncomfortable despite paying for a premium seat on the Doha-Chicago leg. The audio box intruding into the leg space makes a long flight very uncomfortable. The aircraft was clean but was not new. The choice of entertainment was not good especially the Bollywood section which was completely outdated. Qatar Airways crew did not seem to make any rounds with just water or juice. The inflight USB charger did not work on the Mumbai to Doha leg. The crew did not offer any alcoholic drinks without specifically asking for the same.,The seat was uncomfortable
Qatar Airways,"Even after I made it to the original flight at final boarding time by running through the airport (due to Qatar Airways late flight), the staff had bounced everyone to the next flight. I asked whether they could accommodate me since I had still arrived by final boarding time but they still said I had to wait for the next flight. Later when I went to the next counter was I told the delay was a day, so I was stuck at the airport this whole time and they could not even accommodate me in one of their lounges. If I knew the delay would have been so long, I would have argued with the staff more at the check-in gate instead of being polite. After I filed a polite and formal complaint regarding what the airline could do for me, I got a nonsensical response and they could do nothing for me.",stuck at the airport this whole time
Qatar Airways,"In Doha no business class bus was given, just a separate economy bus. Wi fi was not available. I eat gluten free, when I asked for my meal it took an hour before receiving it. Suggestion to have details of the meal available on screen as I was sure what I would get exactly, just that it was chicken. It was delicious though. Friendly helpful staff except that tables don’t get cleared quickly.",Friendly helpful staff
Qatar Airways,"Initial flight from Abu Dhabi to Doha delayed by 90 minutes causing a significant number of passengers to miss their connecting flights. These things happen which most people can understand - unfortunately, there were no updates given until passengers became so irate that they demanded the pilot make an announcement to update us (this happened three times). First announcement: apologies due to technical issues currently being worked on by ground staff. Second announcement: apologies, technical issues now resolved - just carrying out paperwork for clearance. Third announcement: apologies due to technical issues - almost resolved now.  Upon landing in Doha, met by a member of ground staff holding a sign, upon asking if the Manchester flight had departed she said yes. Next flight was in 6 hours - the compensation provided was the equivalent of 10GBP - to spend over the 6 hour wait (a coffee alone was 5GBP). Didn't give access to a lounge. Again, customer service upon receiving the 'compensation' and my next boarding pass was poor - no smile, no apology for the inconvenience. I asked out of curiosity why my bag needed to go through a security check when I'd just come from the plane - the response was that the previous airport flying from could have missed something. When flying flying back from Manchester on the return flight via Doha I didn't pass through any security checks to my connecting flight. One plus point to the flights - food is great, hats off to the chef. My TV on the return flight from Manchester to Doha was also not working.",Didn't give access to a lounge
Qatar Airways,"Fantastic Experience. First time flying Q-Suite of Qatar Airline, have heard many good things about it prior to departure which turned out to be exactly as advertised. You get your own spacious suite, comfortable seat, plenty of storage, great food, all are better than other business class experiences that I had. What really went well beyond my expectation was the cabin crew. From the time I boarded they have always been super attentive with prompt service of what I needed. Special Kudo to Amit the supervisor, Hattaya who handled my section with a smile that can light up the cabin, plus Chenny and Asil who both were in the front (Apologies to the rest of the wonderful crew whose names I didn't quite remember) Moreover, the lounge in Doha is just fantastic. There have been plenty of praise about the facilities so I am not going to repeat here. However I really want to point out that all the staffs are well-trained and always proactively helping out asking for our needs, which is not something I experienced in most of the business class lounge. They were also very serious about the work product they delivered. We ordered a steak at the dining room that turned out to be too well-done and not tender, we made a very slight comment about it and five minutes later the Chef came out and explained to us that they deliberately didn't leave it too rare and we are all travelers so they want to be on the safe side. The only drawback is the inflight WIFI. $10 for a full flight plan is very reasonable so I purchased it right on board. However after I napped the system could no longer recognize me so I had to make another purchase. Again this isn't a huge amount but with everything being top-notched this is a bit surprising and disappointing.",turned out to be exactly as advertised
Qatar Airways,"Frankfurt Terminal 2 checkin and security check was swift and friendly. Contract Lounge rather average. Flights uneventful, crew on the second leg was rather stressed. Why wake one up for breakfast three hours prior to arrival on a 6h night flight? Seats were cramped, slightly better on the CX aircraft. What was very annoying was the fact that the ex Cathay aircraft did not have the usual 4000+ choices entertainment system (which was even promoted after departure), but a different interface with about 35 random movies and shorts and no Audio programs.","Flights uneventful,"
Qatar Airways,"Flight was okay and Doha airport and city both are very nice, amazing place. Problem is customer service on the phone. They don't speak or understand English very well. When you ask for supervisor because you've called several times and they're not understanding, they give you a hard time and say the supervisor can't do anything and try to get you to not transfer. After insisting they put you on hold for 15+ minutes only for the supervisor to get on the line for a few minutes, and every time I called they hang up mid way through the call. They said an investigation would take 24-48 hours, it took 1 week.",Flight was okay
Qatar Airways,Our flight was delayed 2.5 hours due to a technical difficulty and we were made to wait for the transfer buses for half of that. We were given a 45 QAR voucher which wasnt enough for a water and slice of pizza so we had to pay for the difference. On top of that the hostesses were constantly hounding us over having our feet in our shoes (which is a bad idea since feet start to smell inside shoes and disturbs other passengers). All in all I got the experience I would get in a budget local airline and I'd rather pay more using a different airline than to experience this again.,rather use a different airline
Qatar Airways,"The seat was small. The staff was very nice. There was a family of adults in front of us. As the plane took off, the man put his seat in full recline position and did not move during the flight. I had to put my legs under the seat next to him thus preventing my daughter and my wife from sleeping. I tried to tell him several times no answers. When i realised the family father was next on the right i showed him politely. He looked down on me in a very protective way. The staff did nothing on this flight but on the second part of the flight on the second plane another guy got reminded to put his seat in standing position whereas he just moved down the seat a little bit for few minutes. Good point: the food is nice and the videos too.",put his seat in full recline position
Qatar Airways,"Flight on time. Smooth cooperation with their partner Rwandair by whom I arrived with in Doha early morning coming from Kigali. Luggage transfer went smooth, arrived quickly in Hanoi. In Doha I had 12 hours layover; I was eventually denied a hotel stay but had lounge access to their decent Platinum lounge. Onboard, recognised as elite traveller and was well pampered by professional attendants. They secured me 3 seats in a row by applying seat-block for me as elite flier. The plane was not fully occupied as this is a new, additional flight on this route. IFE of high class and movies renewed frequently. Food onboard improving for QR: 3 offerings at dinner, of which I had two dishes of beef, which was excellent. Beers were of ridiculous poor quality, wines were fair, including a sparkling Spanish cava. The wineglasses are so small that they embarrass the passengers. They hold 5-8 cl only. The wineglasses on my previous flight, Rwandair, are 4 times larger. Amenity kit given though rather useless. A hot snack was offered before morning landing in Hanoi. Recommended, can't demand much more for economy class. But bring onboard your own slippers, and headset. Qatar Airways' tickets have become too expensive during Corona.",was well pampered
Qatar Airways,"I flew with Qatar to HKT via DOH (return via BKK-DOH-AMS) using Economy class on the AMS to DOH segment and Business class on the DOH to HKT segment. New interior with plenty of legroom in economy and good service on the ground and in the air. Old business class on the Doha to Phuket segment but still very good with a very nice amenity kit and pyamas provided. Return via BKK, all segments in economy was also good, with a seamless transfer process in Doha. Will keep flying Qatar.",Will keep flying Qatar

Qatar Airways,"Exceptional service with this airline. Caring, warm, personable.  I mentioned to the crew that I don't drink alcohol. Not only did they prepare a glass of non-alcoholic champagne for me, they brought and showed me the bottle just to reassure me that the alcohol content was zero percent. Then after the main meal, they came round to tell each of us, The service isn't over!  And many of the ground staff I interacted with were just as impressive.",Exceptional service
Qatar Airways,"I am writing to express my utmost satisfaction and appreciation for the exceptional in-flight service I recently experienced during my travel with Qatar Airways. I was pleasantly surprised by the level of service and attention to detail provided throughout my journey from Auckland to Doha and back. I received a warm and friendly welcome and their professionalism and commitment to customer satisfaction made my travel experience memorable. I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to Eric and the rest of the team on the Auckland to Doha leg, as well as to Alexandra and the crew members on the Doha to Auckland leg. They went above and beyond. I must also commend the quality and taste of the special meal that I had ordered.  Qatar Airways' attention to dietary preferences and ability to provide a satisfying dining experience is commendable.",utmost satisfaction and appreciation
Qatar Airways,"Both flights were uneventful with the usual good service, but declining catering quality. There is no butter with the bread for breakfast. Despite most of the gates at Hamad vacant, another remote parking position of arriving aircraft with wait for the buses at scorching 38 degrees. Because of this, I had to run for my connecting flight. The old 788 on the 2nd leg of the journey was in a rather poor sate and not clean. It seems someone has poured red wine over the table, and it was still sticky. Overall a rather underwhelming experience for a carrier charging more than before the Pandemic.",rather underwhelming experience
Qatar Airways,"I appreciate the good and warm services provided by every staff ground and cabin. They make this my journey comfortable and relaxing. The money is worth it, the food and beverages were good too. The flight time is right on schedule. Thanks Qatar Airways!",appreciate the good and warm services
Qatar Airways,"Qatar is usually very good, but watch out. They switched us from suites to a very old, not so comfortable business class of a very dated design. No apologies, just you get what you get.  No room for anything. Skimpy travel kit didn’t have a toothbrush. Not what you expect from an airline that claims to be best business class.",switched us from suites
Qatar Airways,"Great seats in business class qsuite and very well mannered crew. I would say that onboard services and staff are as good as it gets and ground service and staff are the complete opposite. Baggage was destroyed on my outbound flight and customer service has been useless in dealing with the issue and made no effort to resolve the issue before my inbound flight. The baggage allowance for business class is 40 kilos. The fee for extra baggage ranges from 10£/kilo up to 18£/kilos depending on the time you purchase it. They forgot one of my special diet meals on of my flights, providing me with  the breakfast on an overnight flight where 2 meals were offered (late dinner and breakfast). What made things worse was the Stewardess trying to convince me that because I ordered the special meal I only get breakfast! Then the supervisor came over to admit the mistake and apologise. Overall very disappointed with one of the alleged best airlines in the world. Service just does not match the level of product they are claiming to provide. Needless to say I won’t be using them again.",Great seats in business class
Qatar Airways,Very frustrating experience with the airline. Paid during ticketing when booking my flight for extra legroom. However that did not get applied even though I have credit card receipt. I was Unable to select a different seat online via their app even though flight was not full. At airport was promised switch to exit row aisle. When I got to gate they put me in exit row center. I am 6’3 and for a 13 hour flight they could have been more accommodating. Poor customer experience. Inbound leg from Chicago to Doha did not have these problems.,they put me in exit row center
Qatar Airways,"I took Qatar Airways on the Manila - Istanbul - Manila route via Doha, a total of 4 different flights and had a very good experience. Ground staff, lounge staff and on board crew always took extra the step to make my journey better. All flights departed and arrived on time. Food and Beverage options were excellent on board as well in the lounges. My only negative comment might be on boarding practices in Manila. There is a boarding card and passport check prior to entering boarding gate which is same as everywhere else. After this scanning the boarding card before boarding the aircraft which is also same but there is one more person only who checks the boarding card on the link bridge and finally the on board crew. I do not think it is necessary to perform 4 different checks. This also causes a long queue on the link bridge.",had a very good experience
Qatar Airways,Fast check in at Prague into A320. Good flight and service. However perhaps sending slightly bigger aircraft would be better. Very nice staff and service. Great food. At Hamad airport transfering with bus was too long,transfering with bus was too long
Qatar Airways,"We picked Qatar for their good deal and nice timing. Furthermore we had good experience last time we flew. During flight from BKK-DOH on new A350 I has a problem with my seat. Could not recline properly. 1 hour after the plane had taken off the seatbelt sign was still on and toilets were still locked. My wife desperately needed to go to bathroom after holding it for an hour. When she went to toilet, staff told her to sit back for safety. In the end my wife had to go and politely force the staff to open the toilet because it was not possible to wait any longer.",a problem with my seat
Qatar Airways,"Amazing service! We booked our return ticket from Manchester to Delhi via Oneworld (British Airways). However, mid-holidays, BA changed our booking and got us removed from our previously booked flight from Doha to Manchester. Despite multiple calls from me and my partner they could not resolve it and kept on promising us that it will be resolved in next 24hrs. Lastly they told us that it will be sorted by BA airport staff at DEL airport. So we were hopeless to be stuck midway in a country/airport (Doha) which is neither the destination (Delhi, India) nor the home country (Manchester, UK). So with our last resort, we reached DEL (IGI airport) 6 hrs before with the hope to sort it out with the BA airport staff and stood in BA queue. We were asked to change queue to Qatar one. Upon talking to the Qatar airport staff, they told us that they are trying and also connected us to the BA airport manager who turned us away saying that there was nothing he could do. While we were explaining to him the whole issue and he was continuously telling us there was nothing he could do, we could see the Qatar staff Senior Airport SVCS Agent  continuously on call and indicating/placating at us that she's trying. Disappointed, we turned to Qatar staff and their agent Aarti sorted us out on the ticket. As soon as she did so, we took her name and thanked her. What BA manager said that he is incapable of doing the Qatar agent did.",Amazing service!
Qatar Airways,"Plane was uncomfortable, and my food was inedible. Upon flying home we had to pay over 900 euros in excess baggage. We were not given the opportunity to swap our luggage to carryon as were were told the plane was leaving. We had approximately staff pressuring us to pay and when I asked to take out a backpack which weighed over 8 kgs they would not reduce the price.  Once we paid their manner changed and we were escorted to our terminal only to find we had 40 minutes left to board. We will never fly Qatar again.",pay over 900 euros in excess baggage

Qatar Airways,"This was an extremely pleasant flight. Boarding in Doha was very efficient but I didn’t like that they let Economy board first and at some point asked all the Business customers to go to another counter which caused a bit of a confusion. The plane was equipped with QR’s QSuite which was a great experience. Service was very friendly, efficient and attentive. There was a lovely glas of champagne or of something else as a welcome drink. The purser welcomed every customer in the QSuite section with their name and a quick informal chat which I found very pleasant because this practice seems to have been abandoned by a lot of other airlines. Then, the stewardess took our food and drinks orders and asked us when we would like to eat. She also explained the features of the QSuite seat. Food was tasty and of high quality. Everybody received an amenity kit (Dyptique) and pajamas. As this was an overnight flight, we soon settled in and I had a very good sleep in comfortable bedding. On arrival, our stewardess woke us and breakfast was served. Deboarding was organized and easy, starting with the premium guests. Altogether, this was a fantastic experience and I can’t wait for the next flight with them.",an extremely pleasant flight
Qatar Airways,"From the moment I settled into my seat the flight was enjoyable. The range of inflight entertainment was amazing, the food was tasty, and the portions were generous. The flight attendants were friendly and efficient. I didn't feel they were in a hurry to clear the meal trays, unlike some airlines. The plane was clean including the toilets. I particularly liked the moving map with the pilot's view camera, better than a window seat during take off and landing.",the flight was enjoyable
Qatar Airways,"It was the worst trip I made overseas! Booked ticket on Qatar website and on return the luggage from DEL didn't arrive at Doha. The rude staff did not allow me to board flight to DFW! After debating with them that the booking was done by Qatar Airways and any connecting flight was their responsibility, I was finally made to stay overnight. Next day reached DFW and again the flight to my destination was cancelled! They flew me to an airport 2.5 hr away and husband had to drive 5 hr to pick me up. No amount of phone support would help. Very rude staff at Doha making you feel as if it was my fault the luggage didn't arrive. They need better logistics with partner airlines. I trusted Middle East airlines over American but its a mistake. Time tested Delta and American are still dependable. A 25 hr journey took 45h.",25 hr journey took 45h

Qatar Airways,"Always good to travel business in a Boeing 787. Prefer this over the Q-suites they have om some flight. Yes the privacy door is nice, but the seats in a Boeing 787 is more comfortable. Service on point as always. Lunch was quite poor in selection and quality.",Service on point as always
Qatar Airways,Qatar Airways has three daily flights between Johannesburg and Doha though QSuites was advertised it did not actually have it. The policy of allowing 2 checked it bags rather than by the kilo gives them a distinct advantage. On this flight the service was very good and since it was an A350 their business class layout of 1-2-1 gives single travelers the choice of sitting alone and having privacy the on board. WI-FI was good and the service was top notch wonderful crew,the service was top notch
Qatar Airways,Enjoyable flight with friendly and helpful crew. Delay in Nairobi airport meant I barely made my connection in Doha and my baggage was not transferred to my flight to Dublin. It was delivered to my home in a fairly remote rural location in 24 hours. I'll be using Qatar Airways again.,friendly and helpful crew
Qatar Airways,"I am a frequent flyer with Qatar Airways normally flying business class but on this occasion I have flown economy. A very big thank you to Janet (Flight Manager QR 06 on Sunday 30th April) and her crew on flight from London Heathrow to Doha a great service. She was simply the best so was the crew who looked after me, nothing was to much for them.",She was simply the best
Qatar Airways,"I purchased two tickets to ensure I have comfort and room to spread out. Got through Atlanta fine, they gave me my ticket but there was an issue at the gate which was resolved. Arrived in Doha and everything went smoothly from there to KL. On the return flight I was delayed hours before they reprimanded me for purchasing two tickets, as that was against their regulations. My ticket and my trip were deleted from the app and had to be redone at the airport, with the trip never reappearing on my app nor the option to review them. Arriving in Doha, the ticket had to be redone a second time and I was forced to show them receipts for my purchases.

Qatar Airways,"I was traveling with Qatar Airways from Doha to Dhaka, Bangladesh on April 17th in Economy class. Earlier I traveled from DFW to DOH in Business class. Cabin crew who was serving us is Rania. Rania was such an outstanding cabin crew, she was very warm, welcoming, accommodating and went above and beyond to make the flight experience pleasant. While serving dinner, they ran out of my preferred meal, she made sure that her colleagues on the other isles had my preferred meal and she brought it to me. Although I traveled in Economy class from Doha to Dhaka, her genuine care and warm disposition made me feel like I was traveling in Business class. She definitely upheld the standard that Qatar airways promise it's clientele and boast about! Thank you Rania, and thank you Qatar airways!",such an outstanding cabin crew
Qatar Airways,"The aircraft was changed at the last minute to an ancient one, with a seating configuration of 2-2-2 instead of 1-2-1 Q-Suites. Offering that kind of configuration for the same price as a Q-Suite is just robbery. Anyway, the crew was great and always willing to help. On the catering side, despite the flight leaving at 2am Qatar should in my opinion have a couple of full meals available for passenger who do not want to sleep right away. The only options were soup or salad or cheese. Given the age of the aircraft, the air was very dry and I could barely sleep.  In the future, I will avoid their ancient 777 at any cost!",aircraft changed at the last minute
Qatar Airways,"The incoming plane arrived one hour late, but despite that they managed to leave on time. The aircraft was new, and the service from the flight crew was great...nothing to fault. The meal quality was impeccable, and they have decent selection of non alcoholic drinks (I cannot drink for medical reasons). One of the best flights overall. But the experience was trashed by the arrival in Doha, as the aircraft got a parking space in the middle of nowhere, followed by a 45 minute bus ride to the terminal.",One of the best flights overall
Qatar Airways,"I love QR's Q Suites. This was the second sector of a flight from the UK. As usual service and in flight offerings were excellent - apart from one thing. Generally I have never worked out why QR pilots announce the start of descent about an hour before touch down when in fact the aircraft does not start descending until about 25 minutes beforehand. In this short overnight flight of less than 6 hours, that cuts sleep time. Specifically, this is the second time I have had QR flight attendants prior to departure take my breakfast requests and serving time, and then get it hopelessly wrong! This time I wished merely coffee, juice and two croissants with marmalade as late as possible. I was asked if this meant about two hours or one hour prior ro landing. I stated one hour. When I was wakened, I discovered it was two hours prior to landing. I then waited about 20 minutes before another FA tried to set up my table for a full breakfast. Asking her to look at the request sheet, there was no apology. Eventually I got an orange juice and a full bread basket with just one croissant. Asking for a second croissant, yet another full bread basket arrived. Only later when I had finished the croissants and juice did the coffee appear. When so much else is so good, this is surely a major error on an overnight flight. It certainly left me in a less than good mood",left me in a less than good mood
Qatar Airways,"I traveled with my family from Nagoya to Dublin via Tokyo Narita and Doha. Our experience was average overall. We flew on 787-8's, 777-300ER, and A350-1000. Seats were good quality and design, but narrow on the 777 especially (10 seats across) even though the leg-room was good. The newest of their aircraft was the best to fly on - the A350, with a roomy and airy feeling, with high ceiling. The in-flight experience was mostly good, but they could be more generous with drinks and snacks between meals. Children don't always eat at the designated times during the flight. The worst part of our experience was the structure of the ground service and connections. We had to re-check our bags in Tokyo for the domestic flights, security checks in-transit in Doha, buses for the Dublin flight in Doha, and QR don't issue boarding passes for the JAL domestic connection.  Overall, I might fly on this airline again but I don't see anything specific that stands out and would convince me to always choose them over a European airline in the future.",in-flight experience was mostly good
Qatar Airways,"Qatar Airways is a good airline, not expensive, no big delays at the departure, good meals. The crew was nice, but not able to help me with the wi-fi on board. I paid around ten dollars for using the wi-fi on board and couldn't use it. It was impossible to connect, and no one could help me.","a good airline, not expensive"
Qatar Airways,"I recently had the pleasure of flying with Qatar airways and was fortunate to have Claire as my cabin crew member. From the moment I boarded the plane, her warm and welcoming demeanor put me at ease. Throughout the flight, she was attentive to my needs and went out of her way to make sure I was comfortable. Her professionalism and dedication to her job were truly impressive. Overall, her exceptional service helped make my flight a pleasant and enjoyable experience.",professionalism and dedication
Qatar Airways,"I had to travel home in March 2023 and it was a most unplanned trip occasioned by family bereavement. Alina and her colleague in Dublin Airport (20/03/2023) were extremely kind and helpful. Alina looked after me so well, she went over and above her call of duty to ensure that I boarded the flight on time as I was having an issue with my covid cert which was not downloading. Just know that I will never forget you! I have been telling everyone who cares to listen about you and Qatar Airways! I've been telling everyone to use Qatar for their travels - as for me, I am bought.",she went over and above her call of duty
Qatar Airways,"3 Legs with Qatar and 1 with codeshare Malaysian on tired B777. The service on board was okay, there were not many drink runs and the food was typical economy food, the seats on B777 are very uncomfortable, leg room was ok. Main issue was the aircrafts are looking tired and the sooner they get their A350 fleet in the air the better. The entertainment system was so so, not really impressed but flights on time and not an empty seat on any legs.",service on board was okay
Qatar Airways,"I have been taking Qatar Airways for 10 years for all my trips to Asia, and I have never regretted having taken this company. I travel 2 to 3 times a year, and always with my family, and I would never change this company for another. We have always been satisfied, both by its very attentive staff, and by its timetables, as well as by its services. I have the gold card, and I have a lot of advantages. Since COVID, prices have gone up, it's true, but I think that's true for all airlines. I urge you to take this company, and I'm sure you won't regret it. But I also and above all hope that Qatar Airways will not change either.  Je prends depuis 10 ans Qatar Airways pour tous mes voyages en Asie, et je n'ai jamais regretté d'avoir pris cette compagnie. Je voyage 02 à 03 fois/an, et toujours en famille et je changerais jamais cette compagnie pour une autre .on a toujours été satisfait, et par son personnels très attentifs, et par sa ponctuation horaires, ainsi que par ses services. J'ai la carte gold, et j'ai énormément d'avantages. Depuis le COVID, les prix ont augmenté, c'est vrai, mais je pense que c'est valable pour toutes les compagnies aériennes. Moi je vous conseille vivement de prendre cette compagnie, et je suis sûr que vous ne le regretterez pas. Mais j'espère aussi et surtout que Qatar Airways ne changeras pas non plus.",always been satisfied
Qatar Airways,"Width of the seats is unacceptable. I can recommend business class, I advise against a longer economy class flight due to the seats.",Width of seats unacceptable
Qatar Airways,"I flew out from London to Bangkok and returned from Kuala Lumpur to London on a 'Multi-city' booking. This review refers to both legs which were in B777-300ER aircraft. I have previously flown Qatar business class, including their Q-suites, but this time flew economy on all sectors. I did have Sapphire lounge access but this is not the same as their business lounges which they reserve exclusively for their full fare paying business class passengers. The planes were full. I mean, literally every seat taken. Considering this, Qatar Airways were outstanding. I have occasionally flown with other airlines on full flights and it can be chaotic, even unpleasant. Not with Qatar whose staff took everything in their stride. The food was excellent for economy class. Would I fly economy again? For two roughly 7-hour legs, probably yes. Really, Qatar Airways make economy long haul bearable. Superb level of service.",Superb level of service

Qatar Airways,"Hussain, the manager at Qatar Airways - Sharjah airport exceeded my expectations with his exceptional service. His friendly demeanor and accommodating nature made my experience with Qatar Airways more memorable. He went above and beyond to ensure that my needs were met and that I had a comfortable and enjoyable flight. I would highly recommend Qatar Airways to anyone traveling and hope that they are lucky enough to have Hussain as their manager.",went above and beyond
Qatar Airways,I was travelling from Miami to India via Doha and from Miami to Doha flight no Q778. Qatar Airways is known for its exceptional hospitality. Cabin crew name Hisham was excellent on his job. Not only he endeavoured his duty by serving the customer but his generosity and courteous towards the passenger makes me overwhelmed. It was very long flight for me but i feel relaxed because of the crew like Hisham who were there to serve us. Thankyou so much.,exceptional hospitality
Qatar Airways,"We flew from KL back to Doha on 20 March on Business Class and the in-flight service was fantastic! Everyone taking care of us from the moment we stepped on the plane had a lovely personality and manner about them. They were all very helpful, had a great smile and provided good information about the business class suites and with selecting our drinks and food for the flight. We would like to extend a very special Thank You to the staff who really stood out with their customer service attitude and made our almost 8hour flight very pleasant. Well done Qatar Airways.",service was fantastic
Qatar Airways,"I found the meals to be poor, seat uncomfortable, and the selection of beverages less than advertised. My flight was late, and when we arrived in Doha there was no support from the ground crew. When I missed my flight due to them being late, no explanation, vouchers, or even acknowledgment of any kind.",found the meals to be poor
Qatar Airways,"Booked single business class flight from Ho Chi Minh to Manchester, an excellent flight on both legs with their old products. I was disappointed it was not q-suite as i wanted to try it out. Had a great sleep on both legs, crew were friendly and very attentive, especially on the 2nd leg of the flight. Came over on numerous occasions collecting items & asking if I required anything. Food was excellent and tasty, kept the champagne flowing & offering snacks. The business class lounge was excellent serving a la carte menu with full table service, would love to spend more time there. I would definitely fly qatar airways again, hopefully a Qsuite.",crew were friendly and very attentive
Qatar Airways,"Thank you for the wonderful inflight experience we had during our flight from Zagreb to Dubai via Doha. This holiday I got to experience 3 popular middle Eastern Airways Etihad & Emirates includes. I must confess the openness and welcome my wife & I felt at Qatar Airways is unparallel to any other. Middle of the night when I went to use the washroom inflight crew with a long smile, simply asked if I need anything, probably some midnight snack or drink, Own me Over that was unexpected. I never saw them without a smile on their face during the entire flight of 6 hours. Specially I want to narrate this incident. I had some liquid items which I bought from Zagreb Airport, a Duty-free store. At Doha transit security when I explained the situation with proper receipts/bills, they were kind enough to call Qatar Airways staff who arranged special packaging and did all the security procedures to get that in the check-in baggage. All that they managed to do, when my flight had only 15/20 mins left for boarding.  We could be nothing more than, offering our gratitude and thank you for going above and beyond.",wonderful inflight experience
Qatar Airways,The flight from BNE to DOH in November 2022 was very pleasant in QSuite and with an amazing staff and great food. I was very happy. The flight from DOH to ZRH on the other hand was on a very old plane and staff didn't seem motivated. My Virgin Australia flight from MEL to BNE got cancelled and Qatar did give me the choice to go without that leg or cancel the entire flight. I had to organise the rebooking myself and they kept sending me e-mails about cancelled flights which every time I had to investigate to find out that there were no cancellations. The Customer service of Qatar ignored my complaint and did not respond.,ignored my complaint
Qatar Airways,"The perks of flying First with QR is the lounges and onboard tranquility. The rest is nothing special. Even using my miles I would refrain to use them on 1st unless I had to forego them. Their excellent business class makes 1st class almost superfluous. The product is conservative, amazing space, and care level as the pax desires. QR markets their 1st class as a “relish the myriad of exclusive offerings”. Business class is similar (better?) and provides better value for the money. A single spoon of Pearl caviar doesn’t make it. The original can was displayed upon request. Sparkling wines in First are expensive, branded Rare and Alexandra (both ex. 2006), but Business has 2 fine champagnes, which are cheaper and good.  The interior of cabin is dull, conservative, with brownish un-inspirational colors. Access to Bar is fine but not only a 1st Class privilege. Tried to preselect food for weeks before flying but it does not work from my departing cities. Could not  access a menu in advance. Lounges, food, space, and service is better than business class. Welcome champagnes on board; given kit and a quality pyjamas. Champagnes served are truly expensive in contrast to the meagre, cheap, industrial sub-quality beers they could offer. Leffe was the least poor. On QR, I have never been able to get an IPA or porter beer. Food not much better than business class, a spoon of Pearl caviar and a deshelled, dry lobster hand does not make the justification nor significant difference.  Had hoped for some outstanding food, but it was close to ordinary. IFE fine big screen. Ground and Luggage: QR has ground handling problems. They refused to relabel my bags to final destination. Staff disregarded QR’s partnership with Rwandair, resulting me to lose my luggage transfer to final destination. Neither QR in Doha nor in BKK were willing to fix it. However, Rwandair fixed it eventually and opted to board me but leaving my bags 2 days behind in Doha before next flight to Kigali. Had to accept. Partnerships with Rwandair has problems of non-aligned systems, separate bookings, BPs not issued reversely, luggage transfer failures, no full lounge access reciprocality. BOOKING Very hard to come around vacant award seats in F, so I had to plan an entire journey around a leg found (BKK-DOH) to accommodate it. Award booking with QR took weeks to book, coordinate, manage, and process. Exacerbated by the fact that my QR booking had to fit into another QR award booking with a partner airline (Rwandair).",Award booking took weeks to book
Qatar Airways,"The best airline in the world, I appreciate the services, good food and the staff were helpful. I now suggest everyone to travel through Qatar Airways.",staff were helpful
Qatar Airways,"It was a very long flight from Sydney to Doha, cabin crew were very attentive and professional. As the flight was only during the night and everyone was trying to get as much sleep as possible, I was very disappointed that water has to be requested. Usually there is some water available in the galley without any asking but this was not the case.  And also the movies available had nothing controversial on the list.",water has to be requested
Qatar Airways,"My daughter left her trumpet on the plane. We contacted Qatar Airways in December and they replied after three weeks in January saying that they had the instrument and would return it. Since then, despite the fact that we have sent many emails requesting information / updates ... we have heard nothing. In terms of customer service they have been terrible. The Qatar Airways flight flight was ok, nothing special.",we have heard nothing
Qatar Airways,"I booked Gatwick to Cape Town via Doha return. I was told that the first sector was a code share from LGW to Doha and would be operated by British Airways I reluctantly accepted this. I got told that on the return journey the Doha to LHR this sector was also going to operated by BA. At this point I told Flight Centre I wanted to cancel all the flights and get a full refund. My travel agent then came back with an offer to change the flight back to a Qatar Airways flight from Doha and to Gatwick which I accepted. We flew on LGW to Doha which was as expected a very average Club experience on an old style BA plane. Doha airport was a nightmare, badly signposted, heaving with people,  Wi Fi was rubbish a very poor experience. Doha to Cape Town in the Q suite is a very nice way to fly. Better than BA first class in many ways. It lived up to expectations and was good news. The day before our return to the UK, received an email from Qatar saying another change of plane and no Q Suite. Could not delay flying back due to commitments. The seat was hard, lumpy and uncomfortable and did not properly go into flat bed position. The staff on board were hugely apologetic but there was nothing they could do. A pretty poor flight to Doha, where we then found the main business class lounge closed and everyone packed into another lounge. The flight to Gatwick not a Q Suite but it was a reasonably modern plane with good service. I wrote to Qatar Airways saying I had not received what I had booked and paid for and got a very polite letter back saying they were not prepared to give me any compensation whatsoever.",not prepared to give me any compensation
Qatar Airways,"Our tickets from JFK to MLE were changed from Jan 31 to Feb 1, 2023. Luckily, I found out before the flight date. On the day of the flight, the flight was delayed for more than 3 hours, and we missed the connection from DOH to MLE. Qatar Airways said they are not responsible for the compensation. Extremely disappointing. We flew 4 times with the airline, the flights were all smooth.",not responsible for the compensation
Qatar Airways,"I bought a round trip business class Lite ticket under the expectation that it would be Q-Suite. I selected my seats in Qatar Airways seat app, which showed the Q-Suite layout. At ATL  check-in I was told that there was an operational issue and the aircraft had changed with an old business class seat. This happened on my return from DOH to ATL leg. As for DOH to BLR and BLR to DOH, we did get a Q-Suite and it was as expected.",the aircraft had changed
Qatar Airways,Wow what an incredible experience with Qatar. I was lucky enough to experience the Q- Suites and I wasn't disappointed. From the moment I checked in I was made to feel special which made my trip even more memorable. I will most definitely use Qatar Airways again and thoroughly recommend their services. Thank you Qatar.,what an incredible experience with Qatar
Qatar Airways,"The first leg from DC to Doha was on the 777-200ER with 3-4-3 configuration in economy which is an awful set up.  My food was inedible but service as always was excellent. I flew Business Class on the Doha to Denpasar route on a Boeing 777-300ER. It was an excellent flight even if entertainment options were limited. Then they informed me they failed to load my baggage in Doha. It was a 10 hour layover and they couldn’t get my bag loaded?  They informed it arrived at Denpasar hours later and said they were waiting for the driver to deliver it. And then nothing, it is 8 hours later and no update or response. No luggage.",waiting for the driver to deliver it
Qatar Airways,"Take off was 2140 and my food was served approx 2330. Kids meals were awful, and my children wouldn’t touch it. The meal service finished approx 45 mins later, lights went off, only for the lights to come on 2 hours later to serve a pastry. So we are wide awake and another 2 hours to go in the flight. Finally landed in Doha exhausted. Thankfully the crew and service were more prompt on the next leg, but my food was awful. Kids were served egg wrap and as there were no meat choices when crew came to us I was served a veg dish which was awful. Doubtful I will choose to fly Qatar again.",Kids meals were awful
Qatar Airways,"Manila to Zurich, I checked in online and been given the boarding passes (from Manila to Doha + from Doha to Zurich) with both seati numbers displayed. Landed in Doha I had to wait 3hrs at the respective gate. On my boarding pass I had zone 4 which is I think the last zone. When scanning my boarding pass it showed seating issues and I had to see staff who said that Economy is overbooked. I was in shock and asked what that means for me. He replied flight is full you, you need to go to Customer Service. And I asked politely why there is a seating number and why I was even been checked in if the flight is full? I asked if he could please check once everyone is on board if there is still capacity in any the plane, I stood there and asked if he could recheck. In the end there was one space left and I could fly, but I received my luggage only the day after.",one space left and I could fly

Qatar Airways,"Madrid - Doha - Sharjah (Round Trip) because of the stopover in Doha in which you can stay up to 4 days in Doha and pay 40€ per night in 5* hotel such as Marriott Marquis Doha. I didn't want to pay the 83€ for the Emergency seat, as it is too high for a 6:30 flights. The seat pitch in the economy seats on the B787 (MAD - DOH), B777 (DOH - MAD) and A320 (DOH -SHJ) is smaller,  a small difference but my knees could feel the difference. The food on the flight is good and of course was happy that on the long flights they offer free wine. In Doha after passport control,  I had to wait almost 1 hour because the flight was a bit late, the waiting place  was so full that there was no place to sit for many passengers. The Wi-Fi didn't work and there were no toilets in this boarding gate.",they offer free wine
Qatar Airways,"I was flying from Düsseldorf to Malé via Doha on Qatar Airways. The service was very professional and at times excellent. The food was mostly decent, definitely above average for Economy. Finally, operations were very reliable. All flights were on time, and the boarding and deplaning processes were well-organized. On the Boeing 787-8 the legroom was awful and restrained by a large inflight entertainment box under the seat in front, the seat was quite hard, and the headrest could not be adjusted on the sides. This seat was probably among the most uncomfortable that I have experienced on a wide-body plane. Overall, I would fly Qatar Airways again if the price is right. But I would not pay a premium for this experience.",Boeing 787-8 the legroom was awful
Qatar Airways,"I was flying economy but upgraded to business, also had to come back home earlier, the customer service representative at Qatar Airways was helpful, so that worked out. I was disappointed as Qatar changed the planes at the last moment and I was really looking forward to traveling in Q Suite, but the journey due to in cabin service was Excellent. Cabin staff Ying and Komal were phenomenal, professional, helpful and super nice, could not ask for a better service.

I will definitely be flying Qatar Airways again.",blown away by the quality
Qatar Airways,"The planes from Athens to Doha and back were extremely old A330-300. Seat space is limited, if you take a window seat there is a metal box in front of you. No wifi, no USB, LCD screen has limited brightness / contrast. Entertainment full of 2nd class movies and series. Doha airport lounge access is extremely expensive and restricted, which offered only 2 different dishes. Impossible to find a proper place to relax, only good option was the shower available. I tried to add the cheaper lounge before my flight but was not allowed because you have to do that 48 hours before the flight. Toilets are quite limited, I had to wait in line for 10 min for a toilet booth. Boarding was organized chaos in all 4 flights, especially the last one from Doha to Athens, where we had to had to use buses. Wait in line for a bus to arrive and delayed departure because of that. Check in was OK in Athens, very slow in Bangkok, had to wait 40 min in line. Food and service was fine in all flights but nothing spectacular, for example no sparkling water. Wifi was advertised in the flight from Doha to Bangkok but it worked only from Bangkok to Doha. In all, a pretty average to poor experience.",extremely old A330-300
All Nippon Airways,"Relatively uncomfortable flight with minimal and rude service. 11 hour flight that was very cramped, flight attendants avoided assisting me, claimed they had no meal choices, or told me they would get something and did not. Quite surprising for an overseas flight, and ANA no less, formerly my favorite airline for economy seating.",formerly my favorite airline
All Nippon Airways,"They canceled my mother’s flight without any announcement to the passengers who were waiting in line for almost 2 hours. The airport flight information displays still showed that the flight was on time even after we were turned away 2 hours later. While we were at the ticket counter trying to figure out what to do next, their manager told us that flight will be tomorrow morning at 8am (which is incorrect because Seattle only has 1 ANA flight a day, and they’re all at 3:35pm). My mother was staying with us so they didn’t even pay for anything for inconvenience of the delay. They didn’t even offer to try and find another flight. We came back the next afternoon, and finally were able to check in her bags and when we inquired about a seat upgrade (like business class since she already had premium economy), we were told that it was full and they couldn’t upgrade her. They provided nothing for any sort of compensation for the inconvenience,",they couldn’t upgrade her
All Nippon Airways,"We were unable to land in Sydney due to adverse weather conditions, and were redirected to Brisbane. ANA went above and beyond to look after everyone, booking 4* accommodation with transport, breakfast, a return to flight to SYD the next day and $100 compensation. You can usually judge a business by how they handle things when they go wrong, and ANA really impressed here.",ANA went above and beyond

The other flight I took with them was late for 1 minute, only 1 minute, and ANA told me they fail to load my check-in luggage to the connecting flight, so I was denied on board. They refused to rebook my ticket because the flight was not late, and the luggage had enough time on board.",fail to load my check-in luggage
All Nippon Airways,"My experience today with ANA on flight NH211 from Haneda to London was far from satisfactory, marking it as my worst business class experience to date. The first setback was a 90-minute wait for business class check-in, an unprecedented delay. The staff seemed overwhelmed and disorganized, leaving counters unmanned for long periods. The frustration grew when informed that my luggage wouldn't arrive with me but on a subsequent flight, with no clear indication of its arrival time. Adding to the disappointment was the last-minute aircraft change. I had chosen this flight specifically for ANA's acclaimed 'The Room' business class service, but it was changed to the old business class on a 777, with no prior notice. The older business class configuration was a stark contrast to the modern luxury I anticipated. The seating arrangements added to the chaos. All pre-arranged seat allocations were discarded, forcing passengers, including myself, to travel in separate seats. The Wi-Fi on this flight was painfully slow and frustratingly unreliable, It's a stark contrast to the high standards typically associated with Japanese airlines. This series of missteps has left a lasting negative impression, overshadowing any positive aspects of the journey. It's a reminder that even reputable airlines can falter, and in this instance, ANA has unfortunately fallen short of the mark.",fallen short of the mark
All Nippon Airways,"I just cannot express how much I love ANA. They are always my preferred choice for domestic flights in Japan. The check in was a breeze, the staff from the counter all the way to the cabin crew were just amazing. For me ANA has an edge over JAL (which is an equally amazing airline) due to the baggage policy which allows 2 pieces (23 KG each) instead of only 20 KG by the latter.",always my preferred choice
All Nippon Airways,"HND-FUK-TSJ and back. Before setting out on this trip, I had one anxiety: short transfers at FUK, 30 min. in the outbound and 45 min. in the return. Our flight left delayed 15 min. because of the heavy traffic in the early morning at HND and was supposed to land on FUK at due time, that is, delayed. However, the flight attendants took considerable care of those passengers flying to Tsushima. They let them deplane first. Then the ground staff was waiting there, preparing for a van, which carried us up to the second flight. What smooth and steady services they offered! As far as domestic services in Japan go, ANA is the first carrier to be picked up. This time also my impression strengthened more thanks to their services.",ANA is the first carrier
All Nippon Airways,"Great airline and deserves its' Skytrax rating. 2 overnight red eye flights. Will be our airline of choice in future when possible. Check in efficient and quick with minimal wait. Boarding and disembarking very organized and fast. All PAX off the aircraft and in the terminal upon arriving at Haneda from Sydney in 5 minutes. Plenty of legroom up against bulkhead seats, Japanese meal choice tasty and filling. Cabin crew receptive to requests and efficient. Managed to get 5 hours sleep in each direction - this was a plus. The negatives - after 9 hour overnight flights Syd to Haneda and return - no breakfast was disappointing. With a morning domestic connection to Sapporo, and no time to eat, with no meals served on the domestic sectors - left us without food until early afternoon. The cabin was too warm and stuffy on both the overnight flights - apparently to appease the Japanese. Certainly did not need warm clothing nor the blanket provided. .Additionally, cabin crew did not come around the cabin offering water or juice resulting in a considerable thirst. Cabin crew dressed in attractive, professional uniform but spoilt at meal times by them wearing aprons - but maybe this is a cultural thing. I did observe a cabin crew member not ask for the window tint to be opened for landing -perhaps a potential safety issue as we could not see outside the aircraft. .Despite the negatives, we enjoyed a very comfortable flight.",enjoyed a very comfortable flight

All Nippon Airways,"My trip included very long layovers in Tokyo and ANA offers lounge privileges to Premium Economy passengers so that was a factor in my decision. I have also flown ANA in the past and been pleased with the service. The seat was comfortable and offered ample legroom and the service was good. The food was awful and the choices were made from a laminated card which was shown to each passenger. The selections were uninspired and served in a cardboard tray. Drinks, including wine, came in paper cups. This was a distinctly un-premier level of service. Having recently flown Air New Zealand in premium economy, ANA was a significant disappointment. They need to up their game if they want to call it “premium”.",a significant disappointment
All Nippon Airways,"Flew flight NH203 which departs at 22.45. Catering on this flight was very poor. No meal service after departure. This is a 14h flight so many passengers are not in a rush to fall asleep and a light dinner option should be offered. All passengers started ordering mid flight snacks even though it was just after take off. This 14h flight only offers one hot meal in Business Class. A breakfast with one Japanese option and two Western options. Of those two western options, one is with Seafood Pilaf. The other option is a plate with cheese and lettuce which ANA calls “continental breakfast”. No warm bread was offered. Very poor catering for a 14h flight. ANA should be offering a brunch style main meal service which would adapt perfectly to the early hours of FRA and lunch time of origin HND. Also, ANA offers poor bedding. Given the amount of ultra long haul flights it operates, they should offer better bedding. Wifi should be complimentary in Business class",Wifi should be complimentary

Also ANA had arranged a ground service lady to greet me at the exit gate of NH78, and accompanied me all the way from T2 to T3 via a shuttle bus (from T2 to T3), got thru' the custom again at T3, and then to the boarding gate of NH879.

All Nippon Airways,"It is easy to understand why ANA is always a 5-star airline. This trip was a perfect example of how good they are. The service is personal, always with a smile. The food (I went for the Japanese selection) was amazing, beautifully served and tasty. And the new configuration in Business is the best I have ever flown. Individual rooms with doors and a mini sofa with lots of space to stretch out. Premium quality bedding made it even better. This was probably the best flight across the Pacific that I have ever taken. If I could give more then 10, I would.","If I could give more then 10, I would"
All Nippon Airways,"I don’t understand why they served unchilled champagne and the same applied to serving Japanese sake. The flight attendants maintained fast and courteous services. But they didn’t spread a tablecloth at the time of a snack. One of them spilled some port on my pyjamas; however, much to my surprise, their devoted work followed. They succeeded in washing out wine stains and drying it out. What dumbfounded me was that as few as 1,500 miles would be credited to my ANA account. Back home, I contacted ANA Customer Relations and voiced my complaint: I asked, “Why does ANA do a thing like this which makes customers find ANA stingy?” A representative answered politely, “Thank you for your suggestion. We accept it as an opinion.”",fast and courteous services
All Nippon Airways,"I had the most infuriating experience with ANA during my recent business class flights from Korea to Japan and then from Japan to San Francisco.  I asked the flight attendant for a meal without meat. The flight attendant was surprised and didn't know what to do about it. So the flight attendant offered me a very small Knorr brand Cup of Noodle soup. On the 13-hour flight from Japan to San Francisco as we took off, I again informed the flight attendant of my dietary preferences. She promised a Sea bass meal and vegetable soup from the menu. An hour later, I was presented with a vegetable soup. Eagerly anticipating the promised Sea bass meal, I was informed that it would be served 2 hours before arriving in SF. They served cold chicken sandwiches and ramen in between, but I thought I would  wait for the sea bass. I decided to catch much-needed sleep, only to wake up to the pilot announcing our arrival in San Francisco in an hour. Panic-stricken, I dashed to the kitchen, begging for food, only to be told that the kitchen was closed. The flight attendant said with a smirk that I was asleep during their food service. When I got home, I found out about the meal request 24 hours before departure on ANA's website. I wasn't aware of it.",meal request 24 hours before departure

All Nippon Airways,"Pretty disappointed with ANA, especially when compared to JAL. Seats are dated and half are very exposed. The Japanese food was generally good and at times excellent. The champagne was undrinkable. The pre-flight drinks (where offered) were from plastic disposable cups. The main listed wine selection on every leg was unavailable. The crew were generally good and attentive. It is such a pity that they appear to be economising.",Japanese food was generally good
All Nippon Airways,"Great service, lovely crew, comfortable seats, lots of leg room ( I am 6'2), roomy toilets and an immaculately clean aircraft. It’s hard to imagine how a 14 hour flight in economy could be done any better. I paid in advance an extra £15 for a special Japanese meal which was most definitely worth it and really delicious, beautifully presented.","Great service, lovely crew"
All Nippon Airways,"Overall was a good experience, check in went smoothly, food was decent for airline food and the staff was friendly. The main downside was that the lounge in Tokyo Haneda was overcrowded.",a good experience
All Nippon Airways,"I’m super unhappy about ANA service. They asked me and my daughter to move our luggage after we have settled down, me and my daughter are both short, but she didn’t offer her help, so that I almost dropped my luggage on one of passengers. Later during the breakfast time, she didn’t offer food to my daughter until I figured it out. My daughter is shy girl, so I had to step out and ask her to bring the breakfast to her. This kind of things have never happened to me before. I’m extremely unhappy about ANA service.",extremely unhappy
All Nippon Airways,"I want to thank you to the staff of this airline as I received a great customer service. While I needed to do some ticket changes on the spot, they come ahead and helped me through very well and quickly. Without their awesome help, I would not have been Able to be on the flight. There were on delays at all also. I recommend everyone to choose this airline. Thanks.",received a great customer service
All Nippon Airways,"Pretty faultless. Another smooth domestic flight with ANA. Bag drop after arriving on an international flight from Singapore at Haneda was smooth and convenient. Got one of their flash sale discount fares, so was reasonable. Free Wi-Fi works well on board if you have the ANA app, but it could probably be easier to connect initially.",Pretty faultless
All Nippon Airways,"The ANA business class product is superior, and in particular the room. The food served in business class is top-notch, and the service is impeccable. I have absolutely no problem with the in-flight experience with ANA. However, their customer service is a joke. You cannot get a human being on the phone without an amount of delay. Every time I call the customer service number, of which there is only one, I am told the waiting time will exceed 60 minutes and to try again later. Today I made four calls to ANA, each time waiting between 45 minutes and one hour before either getting cut off, or getting impatient and concluding the call attempt.",business class product is superior
All Nippon Airways,"Enjoyed my recent flight with ANA from YVR to HND. Flight left and arrived on time. The flight attendants were very helpful, even preparing my bed when it was time to sleep. The seats are comfortable in business class and convert to a lie-flat bed. The seats on the sides are off-set with one directly at the window and the next somewhat closer in and away from the window. Seating is 1-2-1. A common complaint with the 787 is that the windows do not go completely dark as there are no shades but simply window tinting. The food and beverage service was excellent. I always select that Japanese meals with this airline and am never disappointed. The entertainment system offers a good selection of movies and of course headphones are provided. It is no surprise why ANA is and remains a 5 star Airline.",remains a 5 star Airline
All Nippon Airways,"Staff service remains one of the top notch across the airline industry. ANA staff are polite and attentive. Despite I'm sitting on the economy class, the crews still try their best to make sure we are comfortable from the beginning to the end of the trip. Thanks to the 2x3x2 configuration, seats are generally comfortable.",staff are polite and attentive
All Nippon Airways,"Had read, and seen rumors about ANA's HND Lounges closing early due to manpower, or too many passengers in the Lounge. However was warmly greeted, and entered. Had never used the HND Lounge. Lounge was nice, and exceptional. I liked the massive glazing, so see the magnificent sunset over Japan. Announcements were made about our aircraft, not being ready on time. We boarded late. Boarding was quick. I was second to last to board. We headed out, and were served a A la Carte Sandwich. Only one round of drinks. I slept well and woke up to a second meal, with multiple drink rounds. Landed at SFO late, and proceeded through Immigration, and the Luggage Pickup. ANA staff were present there. Have been flying with ANA since 2007, have never been disappointed. Looking toward the next ANA adventure.",have never been disappointed
All Nippon Airways,"Arrived BKK at 0615. ANA was only checking in the BKK-NRT flight. So we had to wait. Check in was fast, and efficient. I used the Miracle Lounge. Was kind of hard to find, and had to be directed by the Kris Lounge Staff to find it. Lounge was quiet, with lots of seating. Boarding commenced, and was welcomed aboard. We took off on time. Meal was served, with multiple drinks rounds. Flight had a Medical Emergency, and a announcement was made for Medical Staff to assist. Cabin Attendants came around with a drink Menu, including Champagne, Sake, and other selections. I had the Champagne. As we approached HND, I was able to see Fuji San. Landed at HND, Captain and Crew made announcements for us to please remain seated, while Emergency Personnel removed the Sick Passenger. Flying ANA on regional flights is fun, and I will continue to use them as I can.",I will continue to use them
All Nippon Airways,"Boarding was on time but with buses, welcome was friendly and tentative. We departed on time. I had preorder Western option from menu. Appetizer and desert was Japanese style, main course was Western style. Breakfast was Japanese style, not my taste. I can understand to want to saw their travelers the Japanese style but when they order Western option, they should respect their choices. There was WiFi available on the flight and is free on Business Class. IFE was good with a good selection of movies. They offered pajamas and collected our coats.",IFE was good
All Nippon Airways,"Tokyo Narita to Bangkok in Premium Economy. ANA Lounge at NRT packed, until just before 5PM. Boarded on time. Seat was extremely comfortable, and I was able to stretch out. While still parked, Cabin attendant approached me, and explained documents for entry to Thailand not required. We took off on time. Quickly I fell asleep. I woke up on descent to BKK. We landed but had to wait over 25 minutes because our gate was occupied. Landed, with ANA telling us what luggage carousel we were on. It's always a pleasure on ANA, and I look forward to the next trip.",It's always a pleasure on ANA
All Nippon Airways,"San Francisco to Tokyo Narita in Premium Economy. Had not flown with ANA since 2018, so I was excited to experience them again, and did not know what to expect. Purchased tickets in October 2022. ANA Counter as SFO fast, courteous, professional, and efficient. Was through extremely quick. United Club Lounge redone, and modernized. They didn't make announcements, so I had to pay attention for boarding. We boarded efficiently, pushed back, taxied, and took off. Cabin attendants walked around, seeing who needed entry documents for Japan. 787-9 seat comfortable, and spacious. Served a drink round, then lunch, with a second round of drinks. Browsed through IFE, but did not see anything interesting. So I Dozed off. Cabin lights were perfectly dimmed. Lights turned on, and we were served second meal. Followed by drink rounds. Landed at NRT ahead of time. Despite a 54 month absence, ANA has shown they do not miss a beat.",they do not miss a beat
All Nippon Airways,"Horrendous seats on the 787, armrest could not be removed. English skills off the crew is bad. Several instances where i had to ask three or four times to get my ordered drink without success. The only good one, was the one which was assigned originally to my side. Most annoying was that although it was already sunrise over Greenland, they shut all windows down from the galley which  confused my biorhythm (it was a dayflight). Check-In in Haneda took me 40 mins, no fast track security and the Lounge is a zoo. Asked for a shower and was told to register at a counter. I am usually the first to criticize Lufthansa for their business class but in comparison i would choose them.",Horrendous seats on the 787
All Nippon Airways,"ANA should offer classes to other airlines on how to treat customers---they are so good in so many ways. First of all, economy class seats are comfortable and pretty roomy. The meals are generous, interesting and tasty. And the staff are just the best. Always giving service with a smile, they engage passengers at every turn. Japan is a country known for its good service and the crew on this flight was the embodiment of the Japanese service standard. On this flight, there was a full lunch with several dishes and then later a pretty tasty snack. Video choices are excellent and live TV is offered as well. It is a fine airline and deserves its 5-star rating.",deserves its 5-star rating
All Nippon Airways,"We did the flight on domestic  from Tokyo to Okinawa, about 3h with my wife and our daughter of 1.5 years old.  At platinum desk they offer to take in check in baggage, baby car and ask the team to prepare a baby cart in arrival. The lounge did have a baby play room star wars. It was great check-in is as well, well organize for family. Overall a good flight with family.",Overall a good flight
All Nippon Airways,"Though ANA is a very good airline, and both the planes and lounges are great, the lack of customer service at this time is very frustrating. You simply cannot reach them by phone. I have spent countless hours trying to reach them.  Covid is just an excuse to save huge money on service. Plus, there are no walk in offices. This will be the last time I use them. If you cannot make a change, or cancel, what is the point? The website keeps showing errors. Useless.",cannot reach them by phone
All Nippon Airways,"Check-in was easy, boarding was done by groups and worked well. FAs were very pleasant and hardworking. Unfortunately my breakfast was awful. We were kept hydrated regularly and an hour before landing,  served a tasty chicken tikka roll. The flight took an extra hour because of Philippines air traffic problems and very little information was given out by the pilot. As a result, we landed an hour late. We had to go through security at Narita which delayed things. However, ANA still managed to get my bags transferred to the United flight for which I am grateful.",FAs very pleasant and hardworking
All Nippon Airways,"Can't expect much for premium economy so the seat, meal and inflight entertainment was fine. What was horrible is the policy to require mask in a 14h flight. What made it worse was the flight was midnight but the counter was only open 2 hours prior, which is normal, but made passengers unable to use lounges. What's the use of paying the additional fee? Also they only opened 2 counters for non Business. Very slow and long 1h wait",require mask in a 14h flight
All Nippon Airways,Very smooth check in with very generous baggage allowance. Boarding was well organized and done in zones. Cool aircraft with Star Wars robot characters talking between announcements. Service was exceptional which is something I’m used to with ANA by now.,Service was exceptional
All Nippon Airways,The check-in and boarding were such a breeze and I really appreciate the zone system that made it even smoother. Very very generous baggage allowance for economy (2 pieces 23KG each). The airplane was comfortable and clean. ANA staff are some of the best out there so expect extreme quality of service. I was surprised that no snacks were served e but that’s not a big deal.,expect extreme quality of service

All Nippon Airways,"Would probably never recommend this airline to anyone. While their staff are nice and did tried to accommodate us, it made absolutely no sense that we are put on two separate seats again. Twice! First time, they were able to change our seats and this time they just say sorry it's full. We even checked in 23 hours ahead and were unable to grab any seats together.

All Nippon Airways,"On 11/13/2022 while checking in for NH880 Sydney to Haneda, ANA employees stood and bowed to its customers, making a commitment to providing the best of service to them. While our arrival at Haneda was on time, we missed our connecting NH239 to Fukuoka due to mandated Covid testing and Immigration. The helpful ANA staff at Haneda rebooked us on ANA243 to arrive three hours later. Upon arrival at Fukuoka, ANA representative Ms. Kitazaki greeted us at our arrival gate. She advised we would have to hurry to make our connecting flight to Guam. She expedited us to the baggage claim area and advised we had two minutes to board the International Terminal shuttle. When she realized we would never get to the shuttle in time, she sprinted ahead 50 yards to delay its departure so we could board. We were the last on and because of it, we made our flight to Guam by 10 minutes. Ms. Kitazaki not only fulfilled the ANA “bowing” service commitment pledge but exceeded it. We would be honored and most grateful if ANA would recognize Ms. Kitazaki as an extraordinary team member of an outstanding airline. With appreciation. Ann and Dayton Auyong, Guam USA",an extraordinary team member
All Nippon Airways,"Taking ANA to Tokyo this morning, the experience is so great and definitely brighter up my trip. All air stewards are friendly, polite, caring and taking initiative to check with passengers on their needs. Nearly every hour, there is a surprise offer such as cold drink, hot drink, , breads, sweets! I am so impressed. Before I alight the flight, the stewardess who served me a yuzu drink earlier even remember me & checked with me if I like the drink .. amazing! One of the best airline I have encountered among my recent years travels. Thank you All Nippon Airways",experience is so great
All Nippon Airways,"ANA All Nippon Airways is the Best. We have traveled on many airlines around the world, but the service on ANA is the very best we have ever experienced. We want to call attention to the four flight attendants Aina, Seina, Ken, and Frame who served us on flight NH849 from Tokyo to Bangkok. All the attendants were great, but these four attendants were all exceptionally professional, hard-working, polite, and attentive. We appreciate all the extras, like the real silverware, selection of movies and the pillows and blankets. (We do wish, however, that there were a vegetarian food option for my wife.) We were only flying economy, but with service like this, they make ANA economy seem like First Class!",ANA is the very best
All Nippon Airways,"No one enjoys a long flight, and ours was over 12 hours, but we really appreciated the quality and friendliness we found on All Nippon Airways! The food was delicious and came just when we felt a little hungry. The airplane was spotless and so well cared for, with lots of amenities even for those of us in Economy seats. The flight was flown steadily and comfortably even though there were storms in the area, and the flight attendants were amazing - professional and kind. What really impressed us though was when my mom accidentally dropped her phone on the plane. It had her ID info in it, and when they found it they sent someone all the way across the airport, through customs, to a different terminal to where where we were waiting at our next gate in order to hand deliver it to us. I wish we would’ve gotten the name of the man who brought us the phone because he even stayed around just to make sure we were taken care of since he knew our original connecting flight had been canceled. We highly recommend All Nippon Airways for the best flight experience possible. To say they go above and beyond is absolutely an understatement. Thank you!",they go above and beyond
All Nippon Airways,"Since travel to Southeast Asia has resumed under normal conditions, I purchased a Business Class RT. All the ANA personnel were very helpful in every way. Business Class were boarded in group 2. It was a very structured and quickly accomplished. Flight service was outstanding and very efficiently done. Food was quite good and well presented. Connecting flight from NRT to BKK was a 789-9. Business Class was maybe half full. Once again the flight service was outstanding. I did think the food could have been a little better amount for a 6.50 flight. We arrived 20 minutes early and very smooth immigration and customs. I changed my flight from Business Class to First Class from BKK to ORD. There was no First Class on NH808 from BKK to NRT. So, I flew Business Class and there was no food until about 1.30 before landing in NRT. Once again the flight attendants were outstanding. After arriving in NRT, I was escorted to the ANA First Class Suite lounge for the 8 next hours. Not very many people in the lounge. I was escorted to NH012 and boarded. Only 3 of us in First Class. The most outstanding flight service began. All the Flight Attendants introduced themselves. After the take-off and the meal service started. It really looked as if was going to a feast. I became quite ill and very cold. They set up my bed and gave me many blankets and I slept for about 8 hours. They constantly checked on me, which I appreciated very much. I did feel better when I woke up. We had to land in Rockford due to weather and did not get to ORD until about 6pm. I would recommend ANA Business class an First Class at any time. US airlines could learn a lot from Asian airlines.",the flight service was outstanding
All Nippon Airways,"ANA boards in groups and aisle seat passengers board last, ie group 5. FAs were fantastic, attentive, polite, treated everyone well. The Premium economy cabin is laid out in a 2x4x2 seating and I was on the aisle, 26D. Be aware that C, D and H seats on the 777 have an entertainment box limiting your leg space but in because the width of the seat is wider, so it wasn't too bad but just annoying. The flight was punctual and everything ran smoothly. IFE was available and featured movies in English but had an extensive Japanese menu. There were no English TV shows, only Japanese TV serials. My food was awful. The main course was very small and very salty and not well presented.It was an odd mix of cold soba noodles, a sushi roll with edamame, a bun with butter and a salad, usually Japanese style potato salad with mayonnaise. They handed out a half sandwich halfway through the flight (egg salad) and drinks were offered regularly. The wine selection was dreadful and my sparkling wine undrinkable.  We were offered eye masks, toothbrushes and earplugs. Everyone had a pair of slippers and earphones in their seat. There was a blanket and pillow but the plane was too hot for use of the blanket. The staff responded promptly to calls and all requests and I was impressed with them. They are way better than SQ and gives SQ a run for its money. After a 2 hour wait in Narita, boarded the 787 for KUL. Again, a smooth journey, food offerings again small, salty and a confusing mix of Japanese and Western on a tray. Note that food offerings in PE is same as economy and their website says they provide PE passengers with a business class dessert but that never appeared. However, we were served Hagen Das ice cream which was welcome. I would highly recommend this airline for punctuality and attentive staff but bring some snacks and avoid their wines.","FAs were fantastic, attentive, polite,"
All Nippon Airways,"I was looking forward to this flight as it would be my first time flying with ANA and heard great things about the airline. I chose and paid a little extra for Seat 30A, which turned out to be a mistake. The seat does not recline, and is up against the bulkhead. The seat is also more narrow due to the built-in tray. Most uncomfortable seat for a long flight. Disappointed that I could not upgrade my seat from Economy to Premium Economy. Crew was attentive and courteous. There were two meals served on this flight, which were average at best.",could not upgrade my seat to Premium Economy
All Nippon Airways,"KUL-NRT-IAD, Premium Economy service. There were multiple emails from ANA prior to travelling leaving instructions on what to do during travel in the Covid era. Some of these instructions are hard to follow and complicating. At KLIA, no dedicated check-in counter but joint check-in with Economy. Check-in staff were good, efficient and handled things without too many issues, lounge access at MH golden lounge which was fine. The ANA lounge at Narita was very busy and had inadequate toilets and seating areas. On boarding, no preferential boarding with PE unlike when I travelled with them 3 years ago. ANA board in groups and the boarding process in KLIA is poor with instructions from the gate staff which cannot be understood. On board, FA's were fantastic, they were attentive and proactive. No noise cancelling headphones on KL-NRT sector but they were offered on NRT-IAD flight. Where ANA falls short is in the meal service. Their meals are small in size and for a 12 hour flight between NRT-IAD, the quantity of food served is inadequate. The food is reasonable tasty but generally noting to shout home about. The cabin was kept clean throughout and toilets were immaculate. The IFA was mediocre. No TV shows, just movies. The seats are starting to show their age but they were comfortable. The leg rest was useless as it didn't offer much support and the buttons used to operate the recline and leg rest were stiff and hard to press. Overall, the flight is good value for money but catering needs to be improved.","FA's were fantastic, attentive and proactive"
All Nippon Airways,"ANA continues to deliver outstanding service both on the ground and in the air. The flight attendants take care of one's every need. Very obliging and incredibly polite. My business class seat was very comfortable and allowed me to sleep for some time on this evening flight into Bangkok which takes some 7 hours. And the food is some of the best available. Unless you don't enjoy Japanese food, always select the Japanese over the Western meal. The dinner they served was one of the best I have ever had on an aircraft.",continues to deliver outstanding service
All Nippon Airways,"Before the pandemic, I flew a lot, though this was my first trip with ANA. The staff were very warm and friendly, as well as professional and courteous. I dread flying, it's something I usually like to be over with as soon as possible. However, my flight was most enjoyable and the time went by rather quickly! Though I flew in coach, I was very comfortable. Even the food, something not usually celebrated out of business class, was quite enjoyable. Your staff on this flight should be commended for their professionalism, attentiveness, and, immense friendliness. I will make ANA my go-to airline.",I was very comfortable
All Nippon Airways,"I flew with ANA from Jakarta to Washington DC with a transit in Narita on Nov 2021. Boarding and disembarking went quite orderly, everybody waited until it's their turn, so there's no jostling at all. The flight was pleasant and the aircraft was clean and spacious enough. Cabin crew are kind and helpful. Even though the second flight was delayed due to technical problems, it was a pleasant experience. The return date on my ticket is 30 March. But I decided to return this month, in february. I called ANA customer service this morning and got Ms Hisae on the line. She was very courteous and patient with me while trying to reschedule my booking, she waited on the phone all the time when I was trying to punch in my credit card numbers to pay for the difference in taxes, which is a minimal amount. It took quite a long time for the process of rescheduling and submitting the credit card number and Ms Hisae guided me patiently through the whole process which took about an hour to complete, and she chose aisle seats for me too. Thank you so much for your kind services Ms Hisae, I really appreciate it very much. I look forward to fly ANA again on my return home this month. I'm certain the services will be as good as my outbound flight in Nov. I strongly recommend ANA for travelers to Japan or the USA.",I strongly recommend ANA
All Nippon Airways,"We flew ANA flight NH 12 from Tokyo Narita (NRT) to Chicago O'Hare (ORD) on January 13th 2021 as part of trip home to Houston after a SE Asia Family trip. We connected to NH 12 from another ANA flight so after passing security we go directly to our boarding gate. ANA requires all passengers to keep their mask on all the time while in the airplane and while transiting except when eating or drinking. Several ANA gate attendant were making rounds checking people's documents to ensure everybody can legally enter the US. This is better than the UA process of lining everybody up in just one line and clueless on what is the requirement for entry for different countries like we experienced in SFO on our outbound trip. Boarding was announced a few minutes early. Boarding was done in groups; Business Class passengers going first then they start loading Economy from back to the front. They called by rows so there is minimum line formed at the gate, and people can social distancing while lining up. The aircraft was a 14 years old B777-300ER (JA875A) but still in good condition. The flight was quite full but boarding was done quickly. Even with the announcements on cleanings already done on the aircraft cabin, we used Clorox wipes to clean tray tables, seatbelts, armrest and screen when we got to our seat. The seat has fixed back and pivots on the upper section and slides the seat cushion forward for reclining, so there is no risk of person in front of you reclining and intruding into your space. There is footrest under the seat in front of you. Entertainment was OK but for an 11 hour trip like this more choice of movies and TV programs will be appreciated. We used our 3.5 jack wireless transmitter and bluetooth earphones to avoid cable tangles from the provided earphones. The FAs on this flight were relatively younger than the other ANA flights we flew last few times. They are very courteous, polite and helpful, and they are cheerful when they were doing their job and their positive attitude helps passengers to relax. Rice crackers and wet towelettes were handed out with the first drink service. Afterwards we were served dinner along with another drink cart service. Dinner was either beef sukiyaki or braised seafood. I opted for sukiyaki and it was really good. Later breakfast was served and the choices are salmon flake omelette or pancakes. I chose pancakes and the pancake was good, infused with lots of syrup along with a chicken sausage. Before we land we got a tomato cheese bread snack. we were properly fed during the trip compared to American airliners. In between meals the FAs going around offering water bottles or snacks every couple hours or so. They also set up a snack and drink basket that we can help ourselves at the back galley. There were two teams of FAs and I can see them all working hard and all were very cheerful and helpful to the passengers. They were all so good that I decided to give them a box of chocolate I got from Narita during our transit. They initially refused saying this is too much for them but I told them they deserve it for their good service and to share with the other Team, and they finally obliged. We had to wait for late transferring passengers so we were around 15 minutes behind schedule, but we caught up along the way and arrived at 1.13 pm, 37 minutes early to Chicago O'Hare's Terminal 5. Deplaning was done very orderly, they called by the rows to deplane so there is no line waiting to get off the plane.","very courteous, polite and helpful"
All Nippon Airways,"Jakarta to Tokyo Narita on 13th January 2021 on the way home to Houston after a SE Asia trip. Checked in online and was able to secure bulkhead seats. Bag drop counter person worked very quick and professional, and put a priority tag on our luggage. Boarding was done in an orderly fashion, Business Class first, then Economy by row from back to front. The aircraft was a 5 year old B789 (JA875A). The seats were spacious, with footrest and leg rest, and a small tray for holding drink in between the seats, and an individual reading light. Aside from us, there is only one other person in the whole Premium Economy section. The aircraft is clean, but we still use the Clorox wipes to clean the tray table, seatbelts, armrest and the screen when we got to our seat. The tray table and screen in the bulkhead seat is folded into the seat and the touch screen is quite responsive. There is enough movies and TV series to occupy us for this 6.5 hours flight. We left 22 minutes late because we have to wait for some late passengers. But we arrived at 3:13 PM local time, a good 27 minutes ahead of schedule. FAs for this trip were very polite and courteous, and quite helpful and cheerful, a better crew set than the previous ANA flight from Tokyo 2 weeks before. We were given rice crackers, drinks and wet wipes after takeoff, then the breakfast cart start making their rounds. Choices are pancakes and white fish, and I chose the pancake. The pancake was fluffy and infused with syrup, and the accompanying chicken sausage and veggies are quite decent. The drink cart making its round again with the lunch/heavy snack before we arrived in Tokyo. Altogether this is a nice flight with ANA, and everything was going very smoothly during the trip.",very polite and courteous
All Nippon Airways,"Flew ANA Tokyo Narita - Jakarta on 31st December 2020 as part of a SE Asia Trip with family. We arrived from SFO on UA and ANA checked all transit passenger documents at their transfer counter before we are given a clearance to proceed to our respective gates. We had time to spare so we stayed at ANA Lounge prior to our departure. Boarding was very orderly and they called passengers by row starting from the back. Most of us have been seated 30 minutes before departure time but had to wait for transfer or late passengers so we were leaving around 15 minutes behind schedule. The plane was an 8 year old 788 (JA805A) but still very clean and in good condition. The seats cushion is fine and here is this net type footrest under the seat in front of you. The load is quite full (perhaps 70-80%) but the flight attendants were able to give out good service. Rice crackers snack, drinks and hand wipes were given after takeoff, and there were two other drink runs afterwards, one with supper and another one with the snack. In between the FAs went around every couple hours to offer bottled water. We got a very good supper (White fish or seafood in red sauce - I chose the seafood and it was good!) and after that a cheese tomato roll snack an hour or so before we arrived. A FA remembers when I asked for sake for dinner but she didn't have it in her cart, and she promptly return with the sake afterwards. However the crew doesn't seem to be the cheerful type. They are courteous and helpful but they are not as friendly as most ANA FAs I met in the past. As usual in a long flight I took a walk to the back of the plane and stretch in front of the restroom near the back galley, and afterwards returning to my seat through the other aisle. When I was passing the galley a FA was asking if I need anything and that I shouldn't be in the back galley area. Well I told her I was on my way back to my seat but since I'm here I'll take a cup of sake and some crackers if she don't mind. It surprises me since in most other long haul flights they always set up a snack basket and beverages in the galleys for people to take themselves and we can always cross the galley when we're walking around. This doesn't seem to be the case - or is it because of this particular route or crew, I don't know. Entertainment works well, and we used our 3.5 jack wireless transmitter and bluetooth headphones to avoid the cable tangle. Movie selection is not too extensive but enough for this 7+ hours flight. We land in CGK at 11.26 pm or 29 minutes ahead of schedule, and deplaning was done quick and orderly. This is a good flight with ANA but I believe we may have a crew set who were not as enthusiastic or cheerful in providing service, or perhaps due to this flight being a night flight but not a redeye because they all looks kind of tired and reserved.",This is a good flight with ANA
All Nippon Airways,"This is the 1st time I was travelling with ANA, and you could understand why customers or aviation fans highly praise  Japanese airlines. Although the seat in this flight was not that comfortable (the model is 767); the food & beverages could help you forgotten the uncomfortable feeling of the seats. The food is really amazing; hot enough, taste delicious, and the most important thing Is that after you have your dining finished; the flight attendants will serve you drink Every 15 mins with a different beverages each time; which I have never experienced on other airlines. The attitude of the flight attendants are perfect; with smile on their face, try to help everything that they can, being professional all the time (Including the ground service as well). I strongly recommend ANA for other visitors to Japan.",I strongly recommend ANA
All Nippon Airways,"Manila to Vancouver via Tokyo. As part Filipino and part Japanese, I’m proud to say that the presentation of the safety video is very nostalgic and very cultural, which is what I love! The effort, cleanliness, quality and excellent service of the Japanese food and care from the flight attendants is superior!  The food tastes freshly steamed and cooked with juicy flavors from the main dish, whereas the small side dishes tastes great, plus mini ice cream for dessert! Entertainment was great too. I even like how they even set up a warning about safety concerns for turbulence impact, reminding to wear your seatbelt and PA announcements on the mini TV screen. The cleanliness in the aircraft, the space and comfortably is superb! My only concern is the room space for the leg space for the economy class in the very back seat which is connected to the wall. Either way, the seat itself with the pillows and the blankets are pretty comfortable and clean!  I highly recommend to anyone to look into ANA, their honesty about operating during a pandemic crisis like at this time is strongly recommended to those who are struggling to return to their homes. I would like to say thank you so much again for your hard work and effort and for taking us home safely during this pandemic as it’s tough to work through this crisis. This is the best airline experience I had  been through.",the best airline experience
All Nippon Airways,"New York to Tokyo with ANA. Unbelievably good from gate staff right through to landing. You have not experienced business class until you fly in the room. Best business product out there. Food was exceptional, FAs were excellent. IFE screen state of the art, but enough movies to get you through a 14 hours flight. Highly recommended.",Best business product out there
All Nippon Airways,"Fukuoka to Vancouver  via Tokyo Haneda. Wonderful selection of beverages, music, movies and reading material in multiple language from a variety of genres. I appreciated the drink menu and that meal times were specifically posted in the booklet. The Kabosu aromatic water and Zange donburi were delicious. Customer Service was pleasant and cheerful while being polite. The photo I attached was from the breakfast which could have taseted better, but the quickness and practicality, with the addition that I knew exactly when it was coming showed me the preciseness of the care that was put into the planning and implementing of this service. I am sure it was easy to dispose of too which was an effective strategy, reducing the anxiety of the last couple hours significantly.",pleasant and cheerful
All Nippon Airways,"Narita to Perth. ANA kept us informed of their actions regarding Covid19 when it was apparent that changes would be necessary due to health and supply issues. A week prior to our flight it was stated that our route would be suspended the day after our flight. Whilst the Australian governments changed their policy daily during this period, our flight remained with on ok status. We flew last night, despite having an extremely low number of passengers. Despite enduring obvious concerns regarding their industry and their personal careers, the flight staff were friendly, helpful and professional. My admiration and gratitude are overwhelming. A great and comfortable flight and any opportunities to fly with them again will be taken happily. Japan, as usual, was hygienic and had diligent use of masks and hand sanitizer everywhere. We felt completely comfortable travelling throughout our 18-day travels, with business as usual, wherever possible.",helpful and professional
All Nippon Airways,"A very enjoyable flight. I flew round-trip from Tokyo to Okinawa and was surprised that even the cheapest fare on their domestic routes includes registered luggage and allows you to choose a seat for free. The cabin crew was outstanding, one of the flight attendants gave me couple of their Star Wars postcards after I'd told her my parents are big fans of the franchise. All in all, I will surely consider flying with them again if I ever find myself in Japan again.",cabin crew was outstanding
All Nippon Airways,"Kuala Lumpur to Los Angeles via Tokyo. The premium service I have received in ANA airline exceeded all the expectations. ANA's aircraft and staff hospitality are awesome, simply they reflects the spirit of Japanese. Thanks for ANA.",exceeded all the expectations
All Nippon Airways,"Bangkok to Tokyo. So I have flown on many airlines overseas now and I will say ANA is definitely one of the best if not the best. Their customer service is great, staff are friendly, the food was good and the seats were perfectly sized for an overseas flight. They were constancy feeding you which was also really nice. I think on a 13 hour flight we got fed 3-4 times, amazing. The only thing I didn’t like if anything was that if you buy a ticket through another airline with them as partner you have no ability to prechoose your own seat or to check in online. Otherwise they are perfect.",one of the best if not the best
All Nippon Airways,"Houston to Singapore via Narita, Premium Economy seat was great. Large and very comfortable. Slept all the way back on the journey. Food was good as well, could have had fewer carbs options, more veg and protein. There was bread, rice, soba - too much carbs, in my opinion. One stewardess kept forgetting my stuff and I had to remind them or bring it to me after a couple of hours. However, I had a really good time chatting with one of the stewardess and she allowed me to stand and stretch my legs whilst waiting for my cup noodle. Inflight entertainment for English movies is limited - if you are flying short return flights, it would be ok but I was on a longer flight so I didn't have sufficient movies to keep me occupied.",Premium Economy seat was great
All Nippon Airways,"Haneda to Kuala Lumpur with ANA All Nippon Airways. The flight into Japan was wonderful. Staff were welcoming and friendly. However, I was a little disappointed with the check in process on my outgoing flight. Once I was told of the weight limit for each baggage, I was given an extra box to move items into (which is greatly appreciated). It would be even better if the weighing scales were pointed out to passengers with the same fate as I in the future. Quite a few of their staff could not understand simple English. This also, should be improved in the future. Thanks for your service during this flight.",Staff welcoming and friendly
All Nippon Airways,"Ho Chi Minh City to Seattle via Tokyo. After we were encouraged to book through their online website by Vietnam staff to save money, we were told by their staff in Vietnam that our infant might be over the weight limit for their child bassinet at the time of flying.  We were told that we should buy another seat for infant to be safe. After checking further their website, I found that the weight restriction for infants in the bassinet is 10 kg. I asked them to refund the tickets, to which they told me I must pay a cancellation fee. I suggested they could refund the ticket with no fee as I booked the ticket only 30 minutes ago. They refused because I booked my ticket on the website I was automatically directed to. I decided to deal with this and hope all would be ok. Finally flight day arrived, and we had no baby bassinet and our seats had been moved from our reserved seats. The agent at the check-in counted was very accommodating and did their best to block a seat for us so that my baby could lay down which was appreciated. Onboard I found the bathrooms ill equipped, my food was average, my seat seemed small, entertainment weak, and supplies seemed lacking for food and childcare. The return flights were worse, not receiving our originally reserved seats, and the staff could not make time to help with our seating arrangement which meant an unhappy babys.  I wrote a review after my first flight, and I haven't received any feedback.",told I must pay a cancellation fee
All Nippon Airways,"Tokyo to Perth. We found the leg room was excellent. Even though take off was delayed by 30 minutes on the ground at Tokyo (due to earlier fog at Narita), the pilot managed to make up time during the 9.5 hour flight and arrive on time in Perth. We felt the food provided was not as good as it could have been. The first meal is served within 2 hours of taking off. It was a passable chicken dish with side dishes of yoghurt, salad and ice cream. The second meal is a snack and is served within 2 hours of landing. Out of Australia, the snack was fine - something like a ham and cheese croissant, but out of Tokyo the snack was an open sandwich with an inexplicable ton of mayonnaise plus vegetables (corn?), I found it horrible. The entertainment options had some recent hollywood movies to choose from - not much choice apart from that. The TV shows and documentaries were poor or non existent. ANA needs to up their game in IFE. The IFE user interface was difficult for me to use and the cabin announcements were far too quiet - I could not hear 90% of what the captain and crew announced during the flight. I probably will not fly ANA again.",found the leg room was excellent
All Nippon Airways,"Los Angeles to Ho Chi Minh City via Tokyo. This is the best airline company. Everything is good. Customer service is the best. Aircrew is super good and helpful, professional. The food is the best etc.",Customer service is the best
All Nippon Airways,"Tokyo to New York. Excellent service began from check-in, with dedicated check-in room and security screening area. ANA Suite Lounge was nice, but I some how found SQ Private Room at Changi, QF First Class Lounge at SYD and the Concorde Room at JFK better. My flight was exactly the day after ANA launched its new 777 configuration to JFK, so I got stuck with the old version. However, the cabin was sparkling clean and showed no need for upgrading. My complaint was mainly about obstructed view from the Cube, and lack of storage space providing the size of the suite. Lavatory was underwhelming for first class, especially when comparing to my experience on the new SQ Suites just a week earlier. Catering was excellent, as expected from ANA. I picked the Western menu with a lot of skepticism but then was surprised about how tasty the dishes were. The wagyu steak was indeed overcooked, as anticipated on board a flight, but it was, at the same time, tender, juicy, and flavorful. ANA 777-300ER had excellent external camera, but they decided to turn it off upon landing, so I could not have a great landing view as I normally enjoyed with other airlines.",the cabin was sparkling clean
All Nippon Airways,"Tokyo to Beijing. First, the ANA lounge was very nice. There was a sushi bar but I did not try due to a long queue. The noodle bar was more than enough to keep me happy. There was no flatbed seats, but that was quite adequate for a regional flight. Service was good. In-flight meal was fine but was not as good as on ANA's long-haul flights.",Service was good
All Nippon Airways,"New York to Tokyo Narita. ANA flights depart from Terminal 7 at JFK. Check-in was quick and organized. As a business class passenger, I got access to British Airways Galleries Lounge, which had just been renovated with ample seating. The boarding process was well organized, and staff constantly apologized for the 15-minute-late departure. This gesture first seemed unnecessary, but it demonstrated a culture of discouraging lateness. The seat was not anything special, but comfortable, in both upright and bed modes. In-flight meals were exceptional, and they were easily one of the best airline meals I have ever had. Overall, ANA deserves its 5 stars.",In-flight meals were exceptional
All Nippon Airways,"Los Angeles to Haneda was fine and service was superb. My return was not so good. After takeoff the crew started to bring out towels and rice crackers. They stopped at row 33 the row in front of me. After a short wait the crew brought out drinks and came to give us, I asked about the rice crackers, crew apologized and started bringing rice crackers and drinks. For dinner service we had a choice of Set A or Set B. We both ordered Set A, and were given 1 for my wife and I was told have a 5 minute wait,  minutes later they started with Icecream service and my wife asked about my dinner that they had forgotten. After 10 Minutes they brought to me but I refused. Every time I got up to use restroom I was asked if I wanted a drink, which I said no.",service was superb
All Nippon Airways,"I had a domestic flight from Tokyo to Sapporo on 21/09 which I'd booked months in advance. On the morning of my flight, ANA cancelled my flight because the aircraft is no longer available. I tried various contact numbers for an hour and did not get through to customer service. I had to be in Sapporo that evening so I booked with another airline which was £350 more expensive. I didn't have time to go to the airport and hope ANA would get me to Sapporo in time. I've tried to source compensation now I'm back in the U.K but ANA refuse any compensation because they say the lack of aircraft availability was due to adverse weather. This is hard to believe seeing as no other flights were cancelled, the airport was functional and I managed to fly with another airline.",tried to source compensation
All Nippon Airways,"Honolulu  to Tokyo Haneda. As a traveling surfer I choose an airline that charges the least, or in most cases free (as your 2nd checked), no hassle and stress free. This Check in was a nightmare as I stood at the counter for 45 minutes because my surfboard bag was too big. Finally they accepted the bag and charged me $200 but the hassle was not worth it.",my surfboard bag was too big
All Nippon Airways,"I had a ticket from Nagoya to Seattle via Tokyo and I found myself staying in Tokyo longer that I had planned. I called ANA and told them that I would not be getting on the Nagoya to Tokyo flight since I was already in Tokyo, but I would still be getting on the Tokyo to Seattle flight. They said that unless I pay them 12,500 yen ($120), that I would not be allowed to get on my flight from Tokyo to Seattle. They considered that to be changing the ticket.  I was simply telling them that I was going to skip one flight but take the other.",I was going to skip one flight
All Nippon Airways,"Itami to Haneda. Short domestic flight. Osaka Itami airport is under renovation, dusty and unpleasant. Check-in was smooth, domestic lounge was spartan (lunch time but no warm food), boarding was robotic, aircraft was extremely clean, with efficient and pleasant FAs serving drinks.",efficient and pleasant FAs
All Nippon Airways,"Tokyo to London. Staff were very friendly, food was nice but only had fish left by the time they got to the back of the plane. In flight entertainment was quite limited in English for such a long flight. Seats were horrendous, the most uncomfortable. Upgrades were heavily priced. Good service all in all, and still superior choice over British Airways and other rivals flying the same route.",Good service all in all
All Nippon Airways,"Houston to Hong Kong via Tokyo. ANA lives up to its reputation as a 5-Star airline and it is easy to see why. I paid US$825, all-in including taxes, for a round trip journey of 3 legs in each way. HKG-NRT-IAH-LIM & back (United Airlines codeshare IAH-LIM). Incredible pricing. Even from the ground, the check-in process (Haneda) was seamless and it took us a mere 10 minutes for check-in and security and immigration combined. Despite the aircraft (B767 & B777) being of some age, their interiors were retrofitted with up-to-date IFE (with a huge selection of the latest movies, no lagging or dead screens), and USB & laptop charging ports. The widebody aircraft meant that overhead storage space was more than sufficient and nobody had any problems finding space for their bags. The legroom in economy was one of the best we had ever experienced in economy. Recline could be better. (I'm 511 or 1.81m and I could stretch my legs out fully), seats were fairly comfortable and I had no problems sleeping 6-7 hours at a go on the 13hr flight and this is in economy. FA service was extremely hospitable. They served 2 meals and a snack over the course of 13 hours. The meals were great and as good as what some average Japanese restaurants would serve. It is also worth noting that the checked baggage arrived with no incident. The only minor gripe, perhaps, is that the 3-4-3 configuration in economy is quite a squeeze. But still, overall, it's hard to complain at such a price point. Even in economy it's such a good experience. They deserve to be consistently at the top of world rankings in all categories.",it's such a good experience
All Nippon Airways,"I flew with ANA on 10/8/2019 from Taipei to Tokyo, and the in-flight service is fine and very satisfied. My scheduled return flight was on 10/12/2019, the day of Typhoon Hagibis. When Typhoon Hagibis was about to hit I got their notification by SMS that the return flight was canceled, but they didn't give further information of an alternative flight. I called my travel agent for help, they told me there is very little they can do on their side, and I have to call the ANA English call center for alternative flight arrangement. I called multiple times, but the line was busy, and finally the call was through, and I was directed to waiting for available service personnel. After 1 hour waiting my call was finally picked up , and arrange us into their 10/13 flight at the same departure time. In the next day afternoon, I got the notification again that my flight on 10/13 was canceled again.  I called the English call center again, multiple times, but I kept getting automatic Japanese audio reply which I don't understand, and couldn't get through to their service personnel.  Later, I found that their call center was down due to surged calls. Next day I went to Haneda airport when the transport services resumed, we were directed to ANA special service counters crowded with passengers. We were told the earliest flight we can took was on 10/18, that was all they were authorized to provide on the site. And we were offered the Eng call center no. which was expected to be available again in the night of 10/13, and asked us to call the center for other possibility. That is ridiculous to me, what is the point of setting up S-counters, and have customers to wait multiple hrs (>4 hrs for us), and then tell us to call a charged call center again for additional help?",return flight was day of Typhoon Hagibis
All Nippon Airways,"Tokyo to Kuala Lumpur. Decent airline but poor ticketing and check-in system. Check-in at ANA counter always takes me more than 30mins because their system indicates that the name on the check-in system and name on passport is the other way around (First name, last name). This happens even though we strictly follow ANA'S online reservation system guideline on how to input names for people from various countries. I explained this to the ground staff at Narita and Haneda multiple times but their response is usually that the reservation system is handled by another department. Discrepancy between reservation system and check in system is definitely a possibility. I can't add my miles because ANA mile systems has a totally different rule for passengers without dedicated first name and last name. So I have given up Using ANA mileage but now using United mileageplus. My family and I are relatively frequent flyers yet we never experience this with other airlines. With ANA, same problem has been going on for at least 2 yrs but we have not seen any improvement since.",poor ticketing system
All Nippon Airways,"Narita to Kuala Lumpur on flight NH815. After arriving at my gate, I started to feel weird as we are boarding through buses. You have to climb up stairs to the plane carrying your hand luggage.  Maybe I have too high hopes for a 5 star Japanese airline. We are paying for service as a customer.",climb up stairs to the plane
All Nippon Airways,"Bangkok to Tokyo Haneda. Flying with ANA is always a pleasure as even before boarding the flight you know that the service will be of a very high standard due to Japanese custom of serving the client! Hence, it was no surprise that the flight has outstanding service from the Japanese and some Thai crew. Drinks and food was served in a superb manner, plane was very clean, toilets very super clean and if or whenever you called for service the crew came immediately, spoke with the most respect and promptly served you. This is a wonderful airline which I feel even Singapore Airlines and Cathy cannot match and they are great. However, what really impressed me was how professional the Purser in charge of my section; Ms Nagakawa was! I asked a Crew member for a customer form not realising that they would consider this as me being unhappy and raise it to their Purser. Ms Nagakawa came to me and said, Sir, you have asked for a customer form, could you give me an outline of what the problem is? The way in which she did it and showed concern made me realise what high standards this airline puts in pleasing a client and if the client is unhappy in anyway, they don't speak down to the client like other airlines do, their senior team members come professionally to appease the situation and help the client enjoy their flight. Luckily for her I had good news about how wonderful the flight was. She so politely spoke to me and appreciated it but that was not just it, she continued to maintain high standards by constantly checking on me and personally serving service of a high standard. An absolutely magnificent Purser who led the team by example and I had one of the best flights of my life. My return flight too was superb with high quality service from ANA. I highly recommend this company for safety, service and most important of all the way in which you as a client are respected! Thank you to ANA for employing such wonderful staff like Ms Nagakawa and the other crew as well as setting such high standards",ANA is always a pleasure
All Nippon Airways,"Perth to Fukuoka via Tokyo. I would like to convey my deepest gratitude to the ANA ground staff/ supervisors in the check in desk areas at Perth International Airport. Before I could check in, I realised that I had accidentally left my mobile phone inside the car that dropped me off and I had no way of contacting them to retrieve my phone. In my distress, I turned to the first airport staff I met and they happened to be the ANA check-in supervisors. I had asked them on what I should do, whether I should check in first or try to retrieve my phone. Instead of providing me a textbook answer or redirecting me to the airport information desk, she offered for me to use her own mobile phone to call my family. I was shocked and deeply grateful. I had to make multiple calls on multiple phone numbers. But she remained She even continued to help me call my family as I checked in. They were patient, calm, and immensely helpful. In the end, I was able to retrieve my mobile phone. I am so grateful for the superb customer service. This is true service, serving with their hearts. 110% recommend. Will definitely fly ANA again!",serving with their hearts
All Nippon Airways,"Taipei to Narita on 8/30 had a serious delay and the way ANA handling it was a mess. First of all, the ANA crew did not know anything about the problem or they knew but they did not tell us, there was no communication between the airline company and customers. All we can do was keep waiting for another delay announcement. A lot of people need to transfer at NRT so the staff let them change the tickets first, that I can totally understand. However, as a business class passenger, I should have the priority to change my flight to other Star Alliance member such as EVA Air, but there was no line for that and after 3 hours waiting in line, one of the staff said the system was closed and my flight cannot be changed. They should just tell us immediately so people did not have to wait for hours. ANA did not arrange a hotel for us, I was flying from JFK to TPE then transfer to NRT, the time I arrived at TPE was 4 am, the time I left TPE was 11 pm, 19 hours of waiting, it was a nightmare. I can assure you I am the passenger who waited for the longest hours. In this case, ANA obvious did not know when the plane can be fixed, they should just arrange a hotel for passengers instead of kept postponing boarding time without explanation.  ANA paid 15,000 yen for communication is barely enough, the taxi from the airport to my hotel was around 10,000 yen, with the tips and tax there’s not much left. At Taipei, food vouchers were not enough, foods were expensive at the airport. 200-300 Taiwanese dollars can’t even get a regular lunch set or dinner set. To sum up, this trip was a nightmare because of this incident. The most disappointing things were the way ANA deal with it. I fly ANA quite often and I always have a good impression, but from this incident, I could not believe it is a 5-star airline.",most disappointing
All Nippon Airways,"Tokyo to Bangkok in July. Wheelchair passenger have to wait for check-in more than 1 hour at Haneda airport. We had been waiting at Special Assistant line for longer than 30 Minutes, then the line not move because the ladies in front of my group have some problem. All staffs come to help her. So we move from Special Assistant to normal check-in line which is faster, wait another 15 minutes and we are the next queue. ANA staff came to us and put our group back to the Special Assistant queue again. Not good service. Total process for check-in is longer than 1 hour.",have to wait for check-in
All Nippon Airways,Manila to New York via Tokyo. I am very happy with the service and cleanliness of this aircraft! ANA and the FAs are very helpful and accommodating. They are also helpful during the flight not only with my baby but other babies too. They are mindful to our needs as a family and always courteous and polite.,very happy with the service
All Nippon Airways,"I’ve always enjoyed flying ANA on its international routes and I’m happy to report that the domestic route I flew was up to the same high standards of service. A very early red eye flight, cheap ticket but a very clean, well maintained looking interior to the aircraft. No food served but the flight attendants were very friendly and helpful without being either overly intrusive or noticeably absent. Seats were comfortable, decent enough legroom that I didn’t feel cramped on the 3 hour flight as well which was a bonus as squeezing my six foot frame into some previous airlines cabins has been torturous. No personal screens for entertainment but there were radio channels available and I always travel with a book so I was quite content. Got me where I wanted to go with no fuss and a totally uneventful journey. Thanks!",up to the same high standards of service
All Nippon Airways,"Yangon to Tokyo. There was a storm in the South China Sea. You'd think that when the flight is cancelled, they'd at least shoot an email to the customers. They did nothing. We went to the airport and was informed that the flight is cancelled. To be fair they did pay decent compensations for hotel and transportation.",the flight is cancelled
All Nippon Airways,Flew ANA from Sydney to Haneda economy and Haneda to Heathrow premium economy and same reverse (premium economy was via a bid process). Flight for economy was reasonable for the cost while the premium economy wasn't as expected in that the degree of recline was less than I expected. The range of movies on the VOD system was very limited and the food was below average. Customer service from the FAs was however excellent where they were very attentive and courteous immediatly offering eye masks and ear plugs on boarding.,the food was below average
All Nippon Airways,Tokyo Haneda to Sydney. Very satisfied with ANA. Their attention to detail is first class. Their service is focused on customer's safety and comfort.

All Nippon Airways,"Frankfurt to Tokyo Haneda. Simply amazing! The CA were very professional, polite, friendly and helpful. The food was delicious and fresh.The seat was comfortable and had a recline different from other airlines (when you recline, it does not dirturb the passenger behind you).

All Nippon Airways,"Delhi to Seattle via Tokyo. Awesome airline! Great service and very courteous and helpful staff. The seat pitch in economy was surprisingly quite comfortable for a long distance adventure like Delhi to Seattle, which without the Tokyo halt was almost 18 hours plus of flying time and even economy class turned out to be reasonably comfortable during this long route. Channel programming was also good and there were some great Hollywood new release movies to watch from, however I would have  liked more movie content. We opted for Hindu Meal, Veg Meal and Jain Meal amongst us hoping to secure at least one good assortment in any of them. Although all of them were laid out well with fresh and high quality ingredients, unfortunately all of the lacked taste. The best amongst them was Hindu Veg Meal (if Indian food is your forte) although that too was served well but tasteless. They  need to change their Indian chefs. Apart from the let down of getting a tasteless meal, the rest of the service cannot be faulted.",the service cannot be faulted
All Nippon Airways,We were scheduled to fly from Hiroshima to Narita and from Narita to LAX. Our flight was 5 minutes delayed. After we boarded the plane we were on our way to Narita Airport. However the pilot could not land The first time it was due to crowd control. The second time it was due to weather. The third time he decided to change the destination to central Tokyo airport. We landed at central Tokyo airport which was the opposite direction we were heading and had to wait on the plane for about 30 min until we could get off. The staff was trying to figure out what to do. After we were allowed off the flight we had to go to a ticket counter and make new travel arrangements. We waited in line along side every other passenger on the same flight. When we were finally attended. We were told our only option was to take a train to Haneda and from there fly to LAX. We spend the day from 8am in Hiroshima until we reached the airport at Hañeda at 1230 am. We were each given $15000 yen for travel expenses. Because we had to take a couple trains and a bullet train to make it to Haneda airport My husband and I informed the clerk that our final destination was Las Vegas we had purchased separate tickets from American Airlines to get home in Las Vegas and due to the flight change we were going to lose our flight. She booked us airline tickets to LAX and apologized about our final destination being Las Vegas. So we lost our money on those tickets. I was very disappointed with this.,had purchased separate tickets
All Nippon Airways,"First time flying with this airline with my family for a trip to Tokyo and back to Manila. Have to say, economy service here is better than some business class in other airlines. Tasty Japanese food, not sure if they have other menus for other routes Very polite, trained, patient and efficient crew with little to no language barrier. Seats had pretty good space with good inflight entertainment from the regular movies, episode of series but they also have current news, sports and my favorite touch, helpful how-to act, culture videos for Japan I am trying to think any negative or inconvenience and there was really none for these flights. I guess ground crew wise, there was a couple of gate switches but when I approached the ground crew they directed me promptly. Maybe they can just improve on letting the other passengers waiting know instead of waiting for people to come to them but no worries. Overall, best airline I've tried so far.",best airline I've tried

A confusion regarding beef/ pork, so it wasn't easy for me as religious one. Mostly I ordered Kosher Meal from website, but this time I choose to search manual by menu and a knowledge by the staff was minus. Overall, it's good flight!","Overall, it's good flight"
All Nippon Airways,"We bought return tickets for 2 seats. The idea was that each of our kids would sit on our laps for the whole flight. We had problems with check-in because since our seats are side by side in a 3-3-3 seat configuration,  oxygen masks that drop in an emergency is 4 per 3 seats. This means that one parent and child sharing a seat can have a mask, along with the two other customers. The solution is to move the third customer in the row of 3 seats to another available seat, or separate the parents into two different rows of the plane.  To avoid confusion at check-in, and to save them the trouble of having to shuffle customers around at the last second, we offered to purchase a third seat today for our return flight. We were declined and told we had to cancel our tickets and buy new tickets. This was poor service. As a result, we are stuck with the stress of possibly being separated for the flight back. It shows the blatant disconnect and lack of knowledge between the people you talk on the phone, and the products they offer. To clarify, they did manage to keep us together for our flight here (they had a customer in the third seat beside us.) Had we known about this over the phone when we bought the tickets, we would have bought the third seat in the first place.",they did keep us together
All Nippon Airways,"Vancouver to Tokyo. This is our first time flying ANA and what a delightful experience. We flew JAL last year in Economy and Business Class and it was a huge disappointment. On our flight in Economy class was 3x3x3 across in seating and we were in rows 29 and 30 GH. Even when the seat infront of us was reclined, there was still ample space and we did not feel closed in at all. The plane felt new and very clean with a fantastic entertainment selection of top run movies. I had time to watch almost 4 movies, Hollywood selection along with foreign speaking films in Korean, French, and Chinese. The cabin crew that we had was fantastic! Everyone was so friendly and helpful and made us feel like VIP unlike other airline crews that you feel did not want to help. The crew always had a smile and extremely friendly. As for our meals, we chose the hamburger salisbury with potatoes and it was delicious. It had 2 cold appetizers and both were excellent. One was like an imitation crab salad and the other an aspic with spinach. A french red or white along with a white sparkling wine were offered as well as sake. Our second meal was a tuna croissant with a yogurt and apple slices. The mini tuna croissant was also very tasty. We really enjoyed our flight on All Nippon from YVR to HND as the plane was so comfortable with great air quality and not too hot in the cabin. The seats were not all cramped together and perhaps it is because it is 3 3 3 across iso so many planes now at 3 4 3 across. We will never fly JAL ever again as it is so inferior compared to ANA. We will definitely be flying with ANA in the future.",cabin crew was fantastic!
All Nippon Airways,"Tokyo Haneda to Vancouver. After six flights with ANA, this is still my favourite airline. I have flown with other airlines, everything from budget to business, but ANA's excellence in food, service, and product make it my top pick. Even in economy class  I felt like a valued customer. The service is friendly and requests are handled quickly. The washrooms are kept very clean. If I had to list two areas for improvement, it would be the following: The first meal is great.  I think it is delicious and excellent value for economy class. However, it is so good that it makes the second meal inedible. On both flights (YVR-HND, HND-YVR), that sandwich in a box is the biggest disappointment. I would almost prefer it not be served at all. Seriously, the Moroccan chicken on the way to Tokyo was great, but while ANA has upgraded from a white sandwich box to a fancy blue one over the years, that sandwich still looks and tastes like sadness and disappointment. Free wifi for everyone. I have paid for wifi before, and it could be better.",till my favourite airline
All Nippon Airways,"Bangkok to Vancouver via Haneda. Every other airline better raise the bar. Great service, legroom, entertainment and meals. Fast smooth flights. Best I've ever flown with. And the price I booked for was very competitive. Had a small problem with luggage transfer, but the customer service at Haneda went to great lengths to solve.",Best I've ever flown
All Nippon Airways,"Early morning departure from Singapore on B777-300ER. Boarding was uncomplicated, and business class window seat was really spacious and private, with only 1-2-1 arrangement. Seating allowed multiple adjustments (electronic), including lie-flat. Multiple nooks and crannies for item storage. Service was quiet and unobtrusive throughout. Menu choices had Japanese or Western on offer, and a wide selection of titbits including ramen as snacks. Crew were constantly around and kept busy with food offerings, but always smiling and polite. IFE choices were good, with wide selection of music, movies and TV shows. Toilets were kept immaculately clean throughout. B777 was a touch noisier than the B787, but overall, still a very pleasant experience.",Service was quiet and unobtrusive
All Nippon Airways,"Shenyang to Tokyo. There was bad communication on this flight. ANA told all passengers before the flight that, due to potential turbulence, all lavatories on the phone could not be used. This is unreasonable. It turned out that there was almost no turbulence. Luckily, the flight attendant allowed me (and others) to use the lavatory. But it caused me psychological dismay. I did not eat any breakfast or drank anything offered to me because I was afraid that I might have to use the lavatory. The ANA staff in Shenyang should not have made such a faulty and untruthful announcement. It is difficult for people, especially older adults like me, to not use the lavatory on a three-hour-long flight.",bad communication
All Nippon Airways,Vancouver to Manila via Tokyo. When I first tried ANA in 2016 when returning to Manila I was so satisfied with the service and the food they offered. I've tried other airline when I returned to Manila in 2017 but not fully satisfied that's why last year I make sure that I fly again with ANA then this year again. ANA is simply the best!,ANA is simply the best
All Nippon Airways,"Flew with ANA from Tokyo Haneda airport to Sapporo in their Premier class. The check-in process was not so simple as check-in team made it more difficult even though our tickets were first class, they checked us in as economy class. After some clarification they realized their mistake. The ANA Lounge in Haneda looks good, however there are only refreshments available and no snacks, therefore we had to go out and buy some food for our children. Boarding was another issue as they have 3 lines of Groups 1, 2 and 3 and although we were in Premier Class with Seats in Row 1 for all 5 of us we were directed to Group 2 boarding line. We certainly were not impressed by the performance of ANA from check-in, boarding and actual flight to disembarking in Sapporo. This was our first time flying ANA in their Premier Class and would dread to think of how they treat their passengers their economy class.",not impressed by the performance
All Nippon Airways,"Phnom Penh to Tokyo. As usual with ANA a very comfortable experience. Flight left perfectly on time after a well organised boarding. Welcoming flight attendants served a light snack quickly after departure at 23h00, which allowed the cabin to be dimmed after less than one hour into the flight. The cabin was clean and comfortable and the entertainment selection is good. Breakfast was served 2,5 hours before landing, which I would have preferred to be later since that only was a few hours after departure.",very comfortable experience
All Nippon Airways,"New Delhi to Tokyo by ANA. Being Vegetarian I was little apprehensive of vegetarian food the airline may supply. To my surprise it was one of the best Indian / Asian / Vegetarian food I had. I have been traveling a lot most in economy class and had a chance to taste varied vegetarian foods in sky but this one was simply delicious. Adding to the joy of traveling was small small courtesies shown by staff during the flight they were polite and normally such behaviour is vanishing slowly and gradually from the Economy airlines culture. The seats were really comfortable and all the items provide wire a brand new look. The leg space was better / equivalent to any top Airlines will provide. I wish that this Airlines will keep this culture in these competitive times. I would have given an extra star, had there been an option of giving. Five stars and above.",Five stars and above
All Nippon Airways,Frankfurt to Tokyo. Simply the best airline even in economy. You feel like you are an important traveller. Cabin crew is so kind and gentle. I am an anxious traveller and they come so many times to know about me. The meal were so good and the snacks are at your disposal when you want. This my second time with ANA and if I could I will always fly with them. The Pilot made a smooth landing in Haneda and smooth take off. One of my best flight. You can bring two luggage of 23kg in economy class. This was the best for christmas gifts.,Simply the best airline
All Nippon Airways,"Manila to Tokyo. Of all the 5 star airlines I have been on, ANA is the best of the best. Cabin crew were so so friendly, cheerful, attentive! They were really amazing. Food was fantastic, seats were comfortable and nice legroom. ANA will be my first choice from now on!",the best of the best
All Nippon Airways,"New York to Manila via Tokyo. The aircraft is really clean, but the seat is horrible, instead of your back going down, your butt is moving forward, the temperature is warm and very uncomfortable. I asked the flight attendant for an ice, she gave me a soda in a room temperature and told me that they don't have ice.",seat is horrible
All Nippon Airways,"Flight NH 111 and return NH 112 between Chicago and Tokyo Haneda airport. Seats on the 2-4-3 configuration were comfortable on the 2 side with my son. Food very acceptable, especially the Japanese option. IFE not touch screen fast, but good selection. Best of all was the great service by the flight attendants. Wheel chair right on departure and arrivals with help through immigration. I will fly ANA again. BTW, my trip originated in Panama, and was given all boarding passes at the origin of the flights going to Japan and returning to Panama.",great service by flight attendants
All Nippon Airways,"I usually fly United Airlines when I travel; however, this time I chose ANA all Nippon Airways and it was like a breath of fresh air! So much better and more comfortable and relaxing, less crowded seats, best food on an airline I've had in years, movies available if you don't carry an I pad, and so friendly the stewardess who attended your every need. I arrived in Manila feeling so rested and thankful for such a great fight. I don't know if it's just the Japanese culture, but the stewardess who attended to me should be given some kind of award for being so gracious and kind! Thanks to ANA I don't fear flying anymore but look forward to it!",like a breath of fresh air
All Nippon Airways,"Tokyo Haneda to London. An outstandingly good flight, with superb food, in fact the most elaborate business-class meal I have ever experienced. A threefold amuse-gueule with pre-meal drinks, then an excellent three-course meal with a good choice of wines. The cabin staff were attentive; the takeoff and landing were both punctual, and the seat comfortable. My only complaint would be that there were no English-language newspapers available except the Japan Times.",outstandingly good flight
All Nippon Airways,Manila to Tokyo. The cabin crew delivers flawless service even in economy class. They are all smiles and willing to help the people on board. The food is very delicious especially the Japanese option. The seat however is a minor setback since it is kinda cramped although bearable enough for a 5 hour flight.,delivers flawless service
All Nippon Airways,"Hangzhou to Osaka. ANA is truly a five-star airline, from my experience flying with it for the first time. I took the flight from China to Japan, which only took 2 hours and 10 mins. We delayed due to typhoon but I could see the effort that ANA group staff and cabin staff have put in to make their passengers happy and comfortable. One thing I would point out is that I could feel the difference between the tones of speech from those ANA staff and those airport staff. And that tone will initially make the first impression for passengers. On board the flight, I was warmly welcomed by the cabin crew. ANA’s cabin crew hold a very high standard service requirement and they conduct that to a very detailed and careful level. In general, the meal was one of the best I have had for this short flight and the seat was comfortable, too. The flight was very smooth as well and the flight crew kept the passengers updated quite well. The most outstanding detail I noticed about ANA crew was their cooperation during the flight. Very tiny details such as a smile, a please, a two-hand delivery, a small candy, and a poster card gift for children really made their service outstanding. If I would ask one more thing from ANA, it would probably be SMS flight status messages as they can be very beneficial for passengers especially for those with unexpected delays. But overall, this flight with ANA was 9.5/10!",truly a five-star airline
All Nippon Airways,Tokyo Haneda to Hong Hong. Overall it was a great flight. Cabin attendants were nice and attentive to details. The meal was carefully crafted and was basically one of the bests I have ever had.,it was a great flight
All Nippon Airways,"Kuala Lumpur to Chicago via Tokyo. Overall, it was a highly pleasant experience with the ground staff, air crew, and service provided by the airline. Flight from KUL to NRT left and arrived on time. Flight from NRT to IAD also left and arrived on time but we were left waiting for about 20 minutes on the tarmac at IAD as there was another aircraft at our gate. Ground staff were quite efficient and courteous for our check in at KUL. Both flights passengers were provided with plenty of food, snacks, and drinks. Food served was always hot and was quite tasty. The flight attendants were attentive and were quick to appear when called upon. Only slight complaint is most of the attendants did not really communicate well in English and were hard to understand. Lavatories were cleaned throughout all flights. Seats on the B789 were quite hard but the B773 were older but much more comfortable. This is the second time I've chosen to fly with them to North America and will continue to use them again in future as they are quite value for money in comparison to other Asian airlines.",highly pleasant experience
All Nippon Airways,"First leg began with 5 hours waiting on JFK airport, returning to gate for refueling and then ruined food, hard narrow seats and in Tokyo offered money for a taxi to a hotel and hotel room until 11 am. I arrived at the hotel at 3.30 am, no food vouchers. Then at 9 at night the trip to Sydney on old 789 with such narrow, hard seats and dreadful food. Return flight to Tokyo on same old 787, 4 hours wait, then finally a reasonable flight to JFK. As everyone mentions the hostesses are sweet and unflappable, the seats ludicrously narrow and hard and the lavatories miniatures with miniature toilet seats. All the flights had more than 90% Japanese clients who all got stuck in to the Japanese food and sake and beer. The planes were spotlessly clean, the hostesses were delightful but the beds and the food were horrible and the treatment of passengers after the long delay at JFK was indecent. I have often flown their Asian competitors and ANA is a distant last.",hard seats and dreadful food
All Nippon Airways,"My family and I flew to Saigon from San Francisco via Narita. The experience was very nice and the best flying experience I have ever had. On both flights during boarding, flight attendants cheerfully greeted each passenger and helped with luggage stowage. On the SFO-NRT leg, I was in the exit row (30H). Before the FA sat down, she bowed to the whole cabin. She also did the same thing after she got up after takeoff, and again before landing. Where do you see flight attendants that hospitable? The meals were also great. For airplane food, it was pretty good. I enjoyed everything. The crew’s grasp of English could use a tiny amount of improvement but overall, they were able to communicate with passengers. I absolutely cannot wait to travel with ANA again in the future for my travels to Asia. If you ever fly to Asia, fly with ANA, you won’t regret it!",the best flying experience
All Nippon Airways,"Bangkok to Los Angeles via Tokyo. Great service with nice flight attendants. Seats were a little uncomfortable, but they’re fairly large considering I’m a pretty tall person. I feel that this is a 5 star airline because the flight attendants have a smile on there face.",nice flight attendants
All Nippon Airways,"ANA's ground crew at LAX is friendly and not much different from their ground crew at their base airports. After boarding, the cabin attendant in charge of the first class section greeted each passenger, introduced herself, and presented pre-departure drinks. Since the flight departs late at night an a la carte menu is offered instead of a full-course menu. I think ANA's catering is the best in the industry. After the meal, the CA offered to set up my bed for me which was very comfortable.",was very comfortable
All Nippon Airways,"Our flight from Hiroshima to Narita has been canceled due to heavy fog. We had to rebook our flights from Hiroshima to Narita, and then to Chicago. It was not an easy task, because connecting flight was not with ANA, but with United and it was originally booked on miles. Thanks to extremely helpful and diligent attention that we received from a staff member we were able to re-book our next day flight. He also helped us to make reservations at the Hiroshima Airport Hotel. All ANA staff were very friendly and did their best to help us.",staff were very friendly
All Nippon Airways,Chicago to Tokyo Haneda. I was satisfied with the service from ANA. the second flight from Tokyo Hanedato Jakarta was good also. Seat are little but that's on all planes in economy. The service was nice also. This will be our 3rd time flying this journey to Jakarta from Chicago via Tokyo.,satisfied with the service
All Nippon Airways,"I finished one movie, and I was still waiting for food. Why do you have to separate drink service from meal service, and they only serve one full meal on a 7 hour flight. Hype with good hospitality but saving cost on food. Movie selection was terrible and very few choices if you are not Japanese. If you fly frequently, like two to four times a month, on you second flight, you'd run out of things to watch.",only serve one full meal
All Nippon Airways,"Tokyo Haneda to Los Angeles. The late flight at 11 pm was terrible, my wife and I were told that there was no food after departure before going to sleep. After wake up, we found the food selection limited and the service for us was non-existent. The business class seats were old and uncomfortable.  This is my last flight on this airline.",seats old and uncomfortable
All Nippon Airways,"Kuala Lumpur to Narita. This was my first time experience traveled on ANA flight. The experience was phenomenon. Truly can feel the inspiration of Japan services once I got on board.  The seat was adequate with 31 inch legroom. What amazed me was cabin crew service. Nice outfit, professional and a smile on their face while serving passengers. One of the cabin crew even personally intro me their signature Sake, “Ichinokura Tokubetsu Junmai Sake Dry” drink on board when I request it. The food was also delicious. A 9-inch LCD IFE comes with variety of movie choice and a set of comfy headset with soft rubber cover over the ears. It was a pleasant flight and truly a 5 star airline. I will consider travel with ANA in the near future.",truly a 5 star airline
All Nippon Airways,ANA has real top Business Class and Economy products. However for Premium Economy the check-in is not premium and I found the seat uncomfortable. It was the first time I saw a transgender toilet in a lounge (Star Alliance Gold ANA); first time a ToTo washing toilet on board.,check-in is not premium
All Nippon Airways,New York to Kuala Lumpur via Haneda. The flight from New York was delayed due to bad weather but the airline made sure I got my connecting flight and also transferred my luggage. Excellent service wide choice of food and beverages,Excellent service
All Nippon Airways,"Flew Bangkok to Los Angeles via Narita. Could not ask for better service from an airline or more polite treatment. Check in was easy on both ends and I was able to select the emergency exit row (which I need because of my size) in advance when buying the ticket. All four planes were spotless and the level of service showed real pride. All flights were also on time and food was good, especially on the flights out of Japan. The only negative thing is that the inflight internet on the cross Pacific flights is more frustration than pleasure, it just did not work well. It amazes me when I see so many Americans at Narita waiting to fly United when both ANA and JAL are so superior.",Could not ask for better service
All Nippon Airways,"Osaka to Aomori return. Check-in was smooth, and aircrafts took off and landed on time. Despite the limited comfort of that Bombardier TurboProp, and moderate but constant turbulence, all crew made everything possible to prevent passengers to worry. They even succeeded in serving some drinks. Great job ANA!",succeeded in serving some drinks
All Nippon Airways,"Hong Kong to Tokyo Haneda. They fly their latest version of 787 for this service (NH860). Business class seats have a table next to a seat, and you can put your laptop, files, etc while you eat. Seats recline into full-flat, and I do not complain about my leg room. I like this structure of seats. The food was served in a course, and wine selection was good. Cabin attendants are always paying attention to their customers. One pity was business class lounge for Singapore Airline was too crowded, and it was hard to find a seat.",paying attention to customers
All Nippon Airways,"Houston to Ho Chi Minh City via Tokyo Narita. The mechanics of ANA service, seat comfort in economy would get highest marks from me. The flight attendants were impeccably polite but English was difficult for many of them. Where ANA falls short was food, even breads were cold despite the galley having warming ovens. The pairings and choices were dismal and I gave up trying to eat for the flight except water and light snacks. The Hagen Daaz ice cream is a nice treat. Their partner/subsidiary, Air Japan that operates from Narita to Ho Chi Minh City flies older Boeing 767-300 aircraft. I'm a small person, but you are really jammed in narrow seats, very uncomfortable flight, no high marks for these folks for the 6 or so hours I was on board. The ANA Gold lounge in Narita is quite nice, even has massager lounge chairs to grab a short nap or relax. Many food/beverage choices, no shower facilities in the one by gate 52.",even breads were cold
All Nippon Airways,"Check-in in BKK was not on a special counter, as advertised. Ground staff (not NH) were not so friendly. No priority lane either, as advertised. Seat was comfortable, and allowed to sleep. However no dinner (a sandwich would have been enough) was served after the 9.45 pm take-off. Only a small nice warm breakfast 90 minutes before landing. Saving money and letting your Premium Economy pax starving is really not fair, taking into consideration the price they paid, and also that they are human beings. Live CNN on board.",Seat was comfortable
All Nippon Airways,"Frankfurt to Haneda. I have reviewed the outward flight (First Class to Heathrow), but my experience in Business Class allowed me to compare the two levels of service offered. My seat on NH0224 was 9H. On the Boeing 777 the Business class seats are staggered and there is no one sitting side by side. There is not quite the same level of privacy as in First, but I found the seat quite uncomfortable. First of all, it is rather narrow and I found that I could not place my arms side by side. They had to be on the armrests, even when the seat was reclined, or made completely flat. For this reason, I was not able to do the latter and did not sleep well as a result. The seat was comfortable enough when reclined, but the screen is smaller than in First, and I was at the distance where wearing glasses made no different to the clarity of the film. The food was reasonably good and, since I was returning home, I chose the Japanese menu. However, I did not feel like sampling the meal offered just before landing. Since the flight was a relatively short 10 hours, this was no hardship. Overall, I think I expected better of a 5-star airline.",I think I expected better
All Nippon Airways,"I booked a business class ticket with Star Alliance, but was surprised for two reasons. One was that my route was from Hiroshima to Amsterdam, but they routed me via London Heathrow, and the horrors of changing terminals and a KLM flight. The second reason was that I was able to use my miles to upgrade from Business (discounted) to First on the Haneda - Heathrow segment. There were eight seats in the cabin, but only three passengers, so the cabin crew made the adjacent seat into a bed and I was able to use my booked seat 1D, as the 'day' seat and 1A as the 'night' seat. Krug champagne was on offer and the Japanese menu was excellent. The individual cabin was equipped with a large screen and I watched three films in complete comfort. I was sufficiently impressed to make reservations with ANA for my next trip to Europe, and I paid the extra and booked First Class tickets both ways. I returned to Japan in Business Class (which needs a separate review), but it will be very difficult to return to Economy.",Japanese menu was excellent
All Nippon Airways,"The first time that I am writing a review on airline services, but I had to write a review for ANA. I was Head of Mission (13 pax) of the Belgian Blind Devil (blind football players) flying from Brussels to Tokyo. ANA offered us excellent support and assistance on the ground level and also on board the aircraft. The service was excellent, extremely kind, polite, respectful and very helpful, with an appreciated anticipating attitude. We flew Economy, the seat space was ok but not exceptional. The food served was good. I can definitely recommend travelling with ANA All Nippon Airlines.",offered us excellent support
All Nippon Airways,"Chicago to Manila via Narita. This is to acknowledge with great appreciation for the kindness and goodwill extended to a senior couple facing a dreaded 24 hour trip to their destinations. We are referring in particular to Julia S-------r who made all the stops to satisfy our needs. It is the devotion to her duty at the counter at O’Hare Airport in Chicago that made our trip take a pleasant shape, and a good start.",the kindness and goodwill
All Nippon Airways,"Flew London to Tokyo. This is the first time that I am writing a review here but I had to write a review for ANA. I am a disabled person, with a hearing impairment and ANA offered me excellent support and assistance on the ground level and also on board the aircraft. Their Customer service was excellent, so kind, polite and very helpful. I flew Economy, I was a little worried as I am 5ft 10in and I know sometimes the seat space can be a challenge but I had nothing to worry about. I found the seats comfortable. The food served was delicious, I was really impressed with the food selection on offer. I can definitely recommend traveling with this Airline.",offered me excellent support and assistance
All Nippon Airways,"Washington to Ho Chi Minh City via Tokyo. I don't usually submit reviews for airlines, but was so impressed with ANA that I wanted to share my experience. In fact, this is the first time that I am submitting a review on Skytrax. Went on ANA recently to Asia and found it to be above the other airlines. Even in economy, their service, cleanliness and food was incredible, so much better than other airlines. Everything was very impressive. Their flight attendants are also the most friendly, courteous and accommodating. Don't think I can go back to the other airlines. So impressed with ANA!",was so impressed with ANA
All Nippon Airways,"The service, efficiency, warmth and elegance in ANA Business Class makes it a truly premium experience. I flew from BOM-SJC via NRT. Both the aircraft were Boeing 787-8, with well conceived Business Class seats. The odd numbered window-side seats offer an added layer of privacy, but all the seats in the cabin are very comfortable, with aisle access to everyone. The cabins and lavatories are clean. Where ANA outshines virtually everyone else is in their service. The flight attendants appear well-trained and attentive to the needs of the passengers. My Hindu meal was surprisingly good (i.e. not greasy). If there's one complaint I have it is that there was no wifi on either flight. Which is odd given that the NRT-SJC route services Silicon Valley.",well-trained and attentive
All Nippon Airways,"I would like to thank all the staff of ANA for the excellent service and positive attitude. They are very polite. I’m in economy, and aircraft was spacious. Convenient enough for 12 hours trip. Food is great too. Flight was a bit delayed because of snow, it’s totally fine. I recommend.",excellent service
All Nippon Airways,"Haneda to Osaka. Haneda domestic terminal is very busy as ANA has been increasing traffic. Luggage drop-off is now automatic and that makes things easier. Star Alliance Gold lounge is appalling, no pleasant greeting, no food and pretty full. Efficient boarding as usual. Perfectly clean aircraft. Entertainment on large screen, mainly with advertisements. Late on arrival with no explanation, which is unusual in Japan. Cost was half of Shinkansen (bullet train).",Perfectly clean aircraft
All Nippon Airways,"Flew ANA from Frankfurt to Haneda. Fantastic flight and really felt the crew were genuine and hard working. There was also a non Japanese Spanish crew member onboard who was fantastic.The toilets were immaculate, inflight meals wonderful and aircraft was spotless. Also throughout the flight, the crew constantly walked through the cabin offering soft drinks and snacks. Top notch service by far.",crew genuine and hard working
All Nippon Airways,"Los Angeles to Bangkok via Tokyo Narita. I booked my flights through United Airlines and was placed in middle seats by ANA for both flights, despite booking this reservation more than 6 months in advance. I called ANA after my outbound flights to change my seats to aisle seats for my return flights later in January 2018 and was told that since I booked a lower class Economy fare (K class), that my ticket had last priority with ANA and since I had booked through United Airlines, their customers had first priority. Therefore, they were unable to change my seats and I would sit in middle seats. ANA chose to prioritize their existing customer base over a new customer. My flight from LAX was boarded by bus and delayed by more than one hour, making my connection in Tokyo very tight (I had less than 45 minutes to get on board the connecting flight before it took off).",a lower class Economy fare
All Nippon Airways,"New Chitose (Sapporo) to Kushiro. This wasn’t my first time with ANA and definitely not my last. However, it is my first time flying a 72 seater Bombardier aircraft as it is a very short haul flight. The trip was completely smooth and the cabin crew were smiling and extremely friendly. The seats were very comfortable and the legroom was satisfactory. The boarding was a breeze even though the check took almost forever due to the 26th of November falling on a weekend but we had no problem waiting in line.",smiling and extremely friendly
All Nippon Airways,"First time flying with ANA from Frankfurt to Tokyo. The cabin crew were extremely polite and helpful. Both, breakfast and dinner were very good. There was just one option left for dinner and the stewardess apologized for the inconvenience. Only thing I didnt quite like was the selection of films, which I found to be a little bit small but it was enough for the flight and there are many TV shows aswell.",extremely polite and helpful
All Nippon Airways,"Jakarta to Tokyo Narita. Flight was smooth with boarding, take off and landing on time. FAs were polite and helpful. IFE on this flight was easy to navigate, with less movie selection in comparison to some 5-star airlines. Window shade is adjusted electronically, making your flight so much better as it provides with proper sunlight according to your liking. No amenities, other than a blanket and the usual economy class headphone. Meals were standard. Legroom spacious and I got no trouble getting in and out. A really good option if you're flying to Japan cities other than Tokyo as they got a bunch of flights domestically.",FAs were polite and helpful
All Nippon Airways,"Washington to Bangkok via Tokyo Narita. If you can fly on the All Nippon Airlines (ANA) rather than an American carrier, do so. I could not believe how nice it was, even in the cheap seats. There was more room, the stewardess were young and beautiful and the food was great. They actually had real metal utensils. I had two fabulous meals on the DC to Tokyo and another on the Tokyo to Bangkok. One meal had chicken and another had shrimp. They were served with rice, vegetables, fruit, and even ice cream for dessert. I had to take pictures of them to show people back in the US. You can also check two bags for free. ANA makes money providing this service so why can’t the US carriers. On the return trip from Tokyo to Washington DC I started to take a picture of the meager meal on the US carrier and was rudely snapped at by a stewardess that said I could not take pictures on the airplane. It was only food. From now on I will fly ANA whenever possible. I never give out my personal info but felt like I had to this time to let everyone know how nice it is to fly ANA.",could not believe how nice it was
All Nippon Airways,"Kuala Lumpur to New York via Tokyo and back on economy class. Five star service from cabin crew, carry smiles with them and responded to my requests with positive attitude. Food options was decent, especially on NRT-JFK route, not so on the KUL-NRT route. However, I find the aircraft on the KUL-NRT route (Boeing 787) is better as the seat could be reclined as compared to the fixed-back shell design reclining system on NRT-JFK route (Boeing 777-300ER), where the lower back support and the seat itself were pushed forward when reclining. The noise level is slightly quieter in the Boeing 787 as well making sleep more enjoyable with less distraction. Inflight entertainment was quite limited as I flew four legs (about 40 hours flying time) on the same month hence I did not have many choices to choose from.",Five star service
All Nippon Airways,"Osaka to Ishigaki. The best flight ever had in terms of service quality starting the ground services, lines and all, the stuff is always on to serve and make the flight more convenient for the costumers. the plan was clean without a single spot. perfect! The food was also very good, not the standard airplane food that you find in the usual flights. Thanks ANA",The best flight ever had
All Nippon Airways,"We flew business class to Tokyo from San Francisco on ANA. The cabin layout is unorthodox with privacy being the focus, even in the middle section where my wife and I sat. Seating was 1-2-1 configuration. Seat was comfortable and an extra long piece of cushion was provided if you need more support. Plane looked very clean and all the controls worked perfectly. Sleep was no problem with the lie flat seat. The Japanese food selection was excellent. Lots of fish on tap. I didn't try the western menu. FA all slim, young and very attractive Japanese females. Did not see a male FA in our section. FA's very friendly and efficient. English not always 100% fluent but didn't matter. Adds to the overall experience. There were only 12 BC passengers so I had the lavatory to myself almost. Will definitely fly with ANA in BC to Japan in the future.",privacy being the focus
All Nippon Airways,"Originally booked to fly BWI-ORD-NRT-KUL on 14 October but BWI-ORD was delayed for over 4 hours so I had to be rebooked out of IAD on 15 Oct. PY to NRT and Business to KUL. Check in at IAD was surreal. I was waiting in line for the ANA counter to open and what a ceremony! The check in staff lines up in front of the check in desk, bowed and wished everyone a good morning in Japanese. Then they silently and graciously got on with their duties. The check-in staff were excellent but the ANA airport manager was really rude and unpleasant when I approached him to ask him a question about the wait for the wheelchair for my mother. That was the only bad experience of the journey. There were many apparent important looking Japanese people travelling on this flight and the ANA staff were bending over backwards to accommodate them at the expense (in my opinion) of other pax. PY passengers had access to the Lufthansa Business class lounge which was simply awful. Only cold food on offer. Boarding was done well and efficiently at IAD airport. Again, service on board was excellent but the food and IFE were disappointing. Mid flight from IAD to NRT, we were served a chicken sandwich which was essentially one slice of bread with a few strands of chicken and mayo. It was not accompanied with any chips or any other snacks which was disappointing for a flight of 13.5 hours. There were two main meals of small portions and again an odd combination of Western/Japanese items. NRT-KUL was in Business class due to the carrier changing the aircraft so we were upgraded to the 787 C class cabin which had a seating configuration of 2-2-2. The beds were angle type and not flat. The food on C class was definitely much better and was attractively presented. Overall, it was a good journey and I would recommend ANA.",food and IFE were disappointing
All Nippon Airways,"Nagasaki to Sydney via Tokyo Haneda on 12 October 2017. Both flights were excellent. Check-in process at Nagasaki was crowded, but all passengers were checked in with ample time to spare. The seats on the plane were in a 3-4-3 configuration, and there was a standard seat width. However, the legroom was brilliant - I was able to stretch my legs all the way, and I am 6'3 (192cm). Inflight service consisted of a drink and a small snack. Transfer in Tokyo was smooth and was also where I experienced first-hand how helpful ANA staff really are - I realised I did not have my passport about 5 minutes before the plane was to board, and the staff immediately leapt into action. Two began furiously calling on phones at the gate, and three left to go looking around at all the places I had been in the airport. They even told me that they would delay the flight until it was found! The passport was eventually handed in to the information desk at the airport and one of the staff then went to pick it up and delivered it to me. After this somewhat dramatic start to the second flight, the rest of the journey was smooth, The legroom was again impressive, and the seats were comfortable enough for me to catch a few hours of sleep. I would highly recommend flying with ANA whenever you have the chance, and they are probably the best choice for flying to Japan.",highly recommend flying with ANA
All Nippon Airways,"Nagoya to London via Tokyo Haneda. Chaotic check-in at Nagoya airport, although everybody got checked in by the deadline. Smooth boarding and punctual gate departure. Very clean cabin onboard the Boeing 737. One drink was served on this short 1 hour flight. Smooth transfer at HND, with great shopping choices. The Boeing 777-300ER  has configuration of 2-4-3 across, with fixed-shell seats. Not the most comfortable economy seats as when you fully recline, your legroom really reduces greatly. But it is still well above average. Food was absolutely delicious (Japanese beef sukiyaki), and the cabin was kept clean all the time. Inflight entertainment was good with lots of choices of movies/videos/audio. However the flight map function did not work for the whole flight. Special mention to the super friendly cabin attendants who offered superb service, as well as friendly chats in the gallery. Overall, extremely good experience and will fly long haul on ANA in the future.",super friendly cabin attendants
All Nippon Airways,"Tokyo Narita to Dusseldorf. So far, the best airline I flew with, perectly on time. Cabin crew incredibly friendly and helpful, aircraft 1 year old (amazingly clean), high level of on-board food and drinks, very nice entertainment system. A lot of space in economy, relaxing seats. Superior in every aspect.",Superior in every aspect
All Nippon Airways,"Bangkok to Los Angeles via Tokyo. The service on the plane was great, some of the kindest crew members. Such respect! On all four flights the food was so delicious. My seat was also very comfortable, I don't have a bad thing to say about ANA!",the kindest crew members
All Nippon Airways,"San Jose to Tokyo Narita with ANA on premium economy. The flight and service were amazing. Check in was easy and efficient. ANA allows premium economy passengers to have lounge access. The lounge was comfortable and was a good place to do some planespotting.  About 10 minutes before boarding, attendants came around making sure everyone knew the boarding time. Boarding was quick and easy and we pushed back really fast. Right after take-off, attendants came around with water and rice crackers. About 1 hour later, lunch service started. I ordered a beef and pork dish with cold soba, fruit, and a prosciutto wrap. Portions were very generous and were delicious. After dinner, attendants walked around giving vanilla Haagen Daz ice cream, which was delicious. Soon they dimmed the lights and allowed everyone to sleep. ANA allows premium economy passengers to have one extra dessert or cold soba noodles. I opted for a dessert, which was either a raspberry mouse or some mochi. I got the raspberry mouse, which was even better than the Haagen Daz. I tried to get some sleep, but I couldn't because I kept drinking green tea. Attendants constantly walked around and asked if we wanted water, and then they would give it to us. When the crew turned the lights back on, breakfast service started. I got some chicken with rice Shanghai-style with rice, yogurt, and fruit. This was equally as delicious. Attendants cleared our plates and begin the landing sequence. About an hour before landing, attendants handed out small candies with different flavors. Deplaning was easy and while we were waiting, attendants asked how our service was and, of course, we said that it was absolutely amazing. When we landed, ANA crew took the bags off the carousel and gave it to each passenger, which was incredibly courteous.",flight and service were amazing
All Nippon Airways,"Tokyo Haneda to Fukuoka. I had high hopes for this airline considering their increasingly large presence in the US market (even more so than JAL). When I heard ANA would begin to fly the new A321 with winglets I had to purchase tickets. The aircraft on board is modern looking, although the cabin seems a bit out of date because they have cloth rather than leather seats. The flight was exactly on time. Flight attendants were kind but did not speak English. I was surprised though to see they did not offer any inflight beverage or snack.  Also there was no inflight entertainment or wifi.",new A321 with winglets
All Nippon Airways,"Hong Kong to Tokyo Haneda on a 9 year old Boeing 767-300. The inflight entertainment is recent, but not the device. I could see the pixels, I could not read subtitles and couldn't select languages / subtitles. We found the food tasteless, my partner had to ask twice to get bread. I was very disappointed by ANA, 500€ for this kind of quality is very expensive.",very disappointed by ANA
All Nippon Airways,"Jakarta to San Francisco via Narita. I am pleased how ANA accomodate my needs during the long line security check point at Narita airport. I have a child with special needs that makes it hard for him to cooperate when the line is long and place is crowded. I was worried that I might miss my connecting flight as it was pretty short. Fortunately ANA sent someone to assisst us so we still have 15 minutes to board the plane. I could not imagine if we had to go in the normal line! That, and the flight attendants were all nice. Thank you so much. I will fly with ANA again when I have the chance.",will fly with ANA again
All Nippon Airways,"Tokyo to San Jose in Business Class in a Boeing 787-8. The ANA Business Lounge at NRT is very pleasant despite the number of people using it. The flight departed on time. On-board service is typical ANA, which is to say it is outstanding. The Business Class seats on ANA's 787 aircraft are very well designed, affording privacy, comfort as well as ample table space for storage. Service is very warm and efficient. On this flight there was no wifi, something I found strange considering it services Silicon Valley's gateway airport. The lavatory was clean except for the toilet seat covers which do not seem to have been attended to carefully. On the whole, a very predictably pleasant ANA experience. The pressure and humidity in a 787 cabin ensures is far better on one's body than older generation aircraft.",it is outstanding
All Nippon Airways,"Bombay to Tokyo Narita in Business Class on a Boeing 787-8. Boarding in Bombay was very orderly. The Business Class pods on ANA are very well conceived, affording privacy, comfort and plenty of table space. In-flight service is excellent, with flight attendants displaying warmth and efficiency. One point of criticism: we didn't see any food until 90 mins out of Bombay and the hot course arrived only after 2 hours. Given that the flight departs BOM at dinnertime, this is unacceptable. ANA should roll out the dinner service soon after attaining cruise altitude. There as no wifi on this flight, another sore point with me. But the overall experience is first rate.",experience is first rate
All Nippon Airways,"Late night flight from Haneda to Kuala Lumpur. The cabin crew were fantastic and the cabin was clean. The seats were comfortable and amenities provided were also sufficient. However, the midnight snacks and the meals can be further improved. Also compared to other airlines, ANA inflight entertainment is very limited.",cabin crew were fantastic
All Nippon Airways,"Tokyo Haneda to Okinawa. High density on a B777 domestic flight, but it's quite comfortable, plenty of leg room.  No announcements in English from the cockpit, and this was a flight to Okinawa, with a lot of non Japanese speakers. Cabin staff was amazingly not particularly nice. They delivered children toys at the end of the flight. On a 2 hours+ flight, it'd be nice to have any food, even a pack of crackers. Drinks were only offered once.",plenty of leg room
All Nippon Airways,"Nagasaki to Naha. This was a smooth and pleasant flight. ANA does not offer online check-in for domestic passengers who have not booked via its website. However, the airport check-in was fast and efficient. Boarding was quick. The seat was comfortable and clean, and a cold drink was offered on the 95-minute flight. Apart from safety announcements, on-board announcements were made in Japanese only. The flight arrived on time and we only had to wait at the carousel about three minutes for our luggage. The fare on this route was exorbitant, regardless of how one bought the ticket, probably due to lack of competition.",smooth and pleasant flight
All Nippon Airways,"San Francisco to Manila return via Tokyo and vice versa was a complete surprise with the friendliness of the attendants on the airplane as well as in the airport. Having traveled a few times to the Philippines, this time was different, using a new airline. I have a son who is blind and needs lots of guidance due to unknown areas was offered assistance on and off the plane. Attendants were waiting for him which was a huge surprise to me because I never mentioned any need for help but yet there was someone waiting as we got off the plane. They even followed us after I refused the service since he had me to guide him. The attendants then left after asking me the second time if he was going to be fine. Also, the steward on the flight going was awesome he noticed when we walked in on the airplane that my son was blind and so he came and counted the seats with him to let him know how many seats were inbetween him and the nearest fire exit were. He did that a couple times with my son to make sure that he understood in case of an emergency. My hats are off to you at ANA. Thank you for making this mom have faith that there are people that care. Take care and always be safe.",there are people that care
All Nippon Airways,"I flew from Vancouver to Tokyo Haneda in Economy Class on June 4, 2017 for my summer vacation. This is my first time visiting Japan and my first time flying with ANA. The seat while being somewhat narrow had ample legroom. There is plenty of open space under each seat which allows you to either place a bag or stretch out if you are tall. The in-flight entertainment was also very up to date, and seeing the movie Your Name on the in-flight entertainment list was a good surprise. Other good parts of the plane itself are the blue lighting, automated shades, and the washrooms which were clean and not cramped. The use of mirrors inside the washroom really help to alleviate the cramped feeling. Food was well presented for Economy and definitely a step up from what you would expect from a typical North American airline. The selection of free snacks and drinks are much appreciated. Finally, the service was polite, friendly, and responsive. The only thing I can fault ANA for is that the in-flight wifi service was very slow. I paid $21.95 USD and it was barely able to load Instagram or even low-quality YouTube videos. I really hope to see free wifi or at least faster performance for paid wifi in the future. But overall, you really can get by without it. I just wanted it for peace of mind during my flight. I'm flying with ANA back to Vancouver and will definitely recommend the airline to my friends.",definitely recommend
All Nippon Airways,"This trip from Thailand to Japan and return was my first experience with ANA but a very pleasant one. Friendly and attentive crew, very good legroom, especially for economy (seat belts ok on international flights but very short for westerners bodies on domestic flights), good entertainment choice, decent breakfast and nice little snack served immediately after departure. Flight was perfectly on time, announcements were good, including the indication of the luggage belt number on arrival. I will certainly fly ANA again.",Friendly and attentive crew
All Nippon Airways,"Hong Kong to Mexico City via Narita. The easiest way to get to Mexico without transiting in the USA. All flights were on time. On the HKG to NRT sector, an old 767 looking tired, leg room is ok but not great, movies not up to International standard, transfer at Narita can be very long! NRT to MEX sector the 787's were clean, very new. Staff were fabulous. I had exit row both ways, Row 20. Great legroom, however the rows behind are very tight 31 inch space. Food again ok, better movies and better screen. I think the staff were superb throughout.",the staff were superb
All Nippon Airways,"I was traveling from Mexico City to Tokyo Narita. Fight deperture 20 mins delay. Ground staff not helpful in Mexico City airport. It's a 14:30 hours flight but didn't have wifi, but have many movie and games. Cabin crew are best I think in the world. Excellent behaviour, polite. Al time they come and ask need anything. Really great in flight service. I did not order any food before my flight departure and they served me chicken and rice. Business class seat fully lying bed 180 degree. Flight arrive 15 mins before of scheduled arrive time.",crew best I think in the world
All Nippon Airways,"Okayama to Tokyo-Haneda. Check in was easy because the procedure of ANA only touched the membership card of FMP and checked the condition. After boarding this domestic flight, they offered a warm consommé soup and cold green tea, with a smile.  As I arrived earlier than planned, I was able to enjoy the sightseeing in Tokyo slowly. However, it was regrettable that there was only a Japanese announcement at the airport. There will be foreigners boarding in this airport, so I would like you to take care of the neighborhood firmly. Also, as a digression, I would like the cabin seats to be wider.",like cabin seats to be wider
All Nippon Airways,"Tokyo Narita to Mexico City by ANA on 20-21 March 2017. Both JAL and ANA helped me to check through my baggage from Jakarta to Mexico City (and from Mexico City to Jakarta a week later) although they don't share baggage arrangement. It was an excellent service from both airlines because I had a long layover in Narita (for over 7 hours) and would like to go to Tokyo for several hours during the layover. I would point out the excellent service from crew of flight NH180 (Narita-Mexico) and NH179 (Mexico Juarez-Narita), especially during meal time. They gave me recommendation on which meal I should choose because I don't eat pork. They even realized that I was (probably) the only passenger who's neither Japanese nor Mexican. One of the crew of NH180 also bid me farewell on my mother tongue. The interior of the aircraft was great and excellent. The crews cleaned the lavatory on a regular basis so it was perfectly clean and comfortable. The inflight entertainment was also good though maybe they can add more western entertainment. I had no problem though because I do enjoy Japanese movie and music. The leg room of the economy class was narrow. All in all, ANA is definitely a 5-star airline and highly recommended for long haul flight. I hope I can fly with ANA again someday.",definitely a 5-star airline
All Nippon Airways,"Sapporo to Tokyo Haneda. Flying back to Tokyo after our time at the snow resort. Everything from check-in to baggage drop went quite smoothly. The flight was delayed 30 mins due to late arrival, these things happen so it's best to expect it when travelling, seats felt less comfortable then previous flight and in regards to onboard experience I think food should be served on a 1.5 hour flight. Some people might think otherwise and not agree with my opinion but for a full service airline, it should be expected. Baggage did take up to 30 mins to come out, but that is the airport's responsibility. Overall, I definitely would fly with ANA again.",definitely fly with ANA again
All Nippon Airways,"Shanghai to Tokyo Haneda. The staff are faultlessly professional and polite and cheerful, the cabin was spotlessly clean. The vegetarian option was very tasty - a tofu salad or a chickpea patty with pasta. My only two concerns were: On most flights requesting a special meal means receiving the meal ahead of the rest of the passengers, but this time I waited while the rows around me were served while the attendant went to fetch my meal from the galley. This wasn't such a big deal, since it was only a slight delay, but it was different than my experience on other airlines. The in-flight entertainment was quite limited.  Overall, nice experience. I would fly with them again.",faultlessly professional
All Nippon Airways,"Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo Narita. This was our family first flight with ANA. The reason we chose ANA was due to it's connectivity and relatively cheap airfare, as we were flying multi-cities in Japan. The seat width was reasonable and legroom was good. Cabin service is one of the best. The window tinting feature of Boeing 787 is very unique and hightech. One setback was the fabric seat getting hot after flown for hours. It would be better if the aircraft were fitted with leather seats. Announcements were generally made in Japanese with only important short messages announced in English.",Cabin service one of the best
All Nippon Airways,"Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo Haneda return In summary the service by the cabin crew on both sectors were impeccable and the details of the service on board was top notch. I flew 2 elderly passengers, 1 wheelchair passenger and a 5yr old child. We were all well taken care of from the boarding point right to the moment we disembarked after the immigration office by ANA ground staff. Food selection is better than most airlines. Chair did not recline well but was sufficient. Cabin crew was extremely polite and was always visible in the cabin making sure every passenger was attended to. Upon arrival the baggage delivery was prompt and quick. On our return trip on of the passengers from my group was seated separately. However, they went through all the trouble to assign us a seat together despite the full flight HND KUL. The service overall surpassed my expectations. I will always plan my trips on ANA in future where possible.",surpassed my expectations
All Nippon Airways,"Tokyo Haneda to Kuala Lumpur. My flight was scheduled to depart from Tokyo Haneda at 0005 hrs in the morning. Chose ANA because of the offered price.  The plane was very clean upon boarding. The window tinting feature on the Boeing 787 is very nice! Flight took off on time. Cabin crew were really attentive and friendly. Food was delicious. However, my IFE system got jammed after watching a movie. I reported the problem to the cabin crew and they quickly restarted the system for me. I was really happy with that. The recline of the seats wasn't very good. Couldn't get much sleep because it was uncomfortable. Landed in KLIA, on time as scheduled ( 630 hrs). Baggage reclaim was a breeze! They unloaded the baggages really fast. It was an honor flying with ANA and I will be sure to recommend this airline to others.",crew really attentive and friendly
All Nippon Airways,"Tokyo Narita to Singapore. I have flown ANA several times on both economy and premium economy cabin and it is a seemless ride, wonderful service from both ground and inflight crews.  You really get the feeling that ANA staff care about their clients. Food is delicious, great quality of wines, IFE with plenty of choices. The 2x4x3 configuration is the best layout I ever saw on a Boeing 777. Only downside is how the Y seat reclines, instead of your back reclining, it is your hips that slide forwards hence reducing your leg room. Hard to describe but the economy seat isn't reclining the traditional way thus making it a biy uncomfortable, and I decided not to recline. The premium economy seats recline well. Besides that ANA is a well deserved 5-Star airline.",staff care about their clients
All Nippon Airways,"Tokyo Haneda to Frankfurt in business class. Check in and lounge at Haneda exceptional and so efficient. Onboard the Boeing 777 seats are nice and private, a little narrow but I'm large! Food was excellent and seemed more refined than many airlines. Staff service exceptional and the best I can remember in over 25 years of flying - well done. IFE good movie choices, but TV programs seemed rather small in choice. Will choose next time over Lufthansa.",staff service exceptional
All Nippon Airways,"Haneda to New York JFK in late December 2016 with a return on January 4 in Business class. First, from a convenience stand point this flight cannot be beat. It is great to have a Haneda option to JFK available that avoids the 1.5 to 2hr transit from central Tokyo out to Narita where most US flights originate and land. I like ANA's seat configuration and the window seats with the side table on the aisle cannot be beat for privacy. You'll want to check the seat configuration on your specific flight as every other row alternates and other rows have seats where the side table is against the window. This second design exposes you more, but is also fine. Service is generally great, unobtrusive and responsive. Compared to JAL, the HND connection is a winner. Where ANA falls flat I think is food and the IFE system, for non-Japanese speakers. The selection is OK, but nothing great compared to Cathay where has a very large library available on demand. One thing I have noticed on Asian carriers is that the temperature is too high for most westerners. I find overly heated spaces claustrophobic. Dress in layers if you are heat sensitive. I have learned to carry a light cotton polo shirt in my carry on bag that I can slip on if necessary once on board. My complaint is the food. It is sometimes poor, especially the main meal, and this includes both the Japanese and International options. On the upside though is that the a la carte options that may be ordered at any time after the first meal are much better, especially the curry, salad, cheeses, fruit, ramen and other simple dishes. I think with the main meal they try too hard and fail. Overall ANA is head and shoulders above any US carrier, and I will continue to fly them regularly.",HND connection is a winner
All Nippon Airways,"Flew ANA to Singapore from Tokyo as a connection from United originating in Newark. It was a world of difference transferring from United to ANA. Boarding was by row numbers and fairly organized and quick. The aircraft itself has an interesting 2x4x3 layout in Economy which I quite liked. Seat pitch was excellent at 34 and I did also like that the seat slid forward instead of reclined back. The crew were lovely, welcoming and gracious. Meals and drinks were served efficiently and with a genuine friendliness. I chose the Japanese option for dinner and it was pretty good and substantial in quantity. The crew's command of English was fair I would say. IFE on a bright touchscreen that was responsive. The selection was decent for a 7 hour flight but probably too small for a longer transpacific. WIFI was spotty and dropped out from time to time. We departed about 30mins late and arrived 20mins behind schedule after midnight. My return flight with ANA was equally commendable. Comfortable, great meals, fantastic crew. I was almost sad to be connecting to United. Which actually wasn't as bad as I imagined but not as good as ANA in terms of amenities and comfort.","crew were lovely, welcoming and gracious"
All Nippon Airways,"Unexpected disappointment. After having wrote numerous favorable reviews to ANA, I have an unpleasant surprise, that might be due to year-end excess of passengers. Service was the opposite of what it used to be on transpacific flight. Lounge at HND was overcrowded, wi-fi slow, no seats available, wines out of stock, etc. Business class passengers were boarded as cattle as we were very rudely urged to hurry up. No FA at the plane door! We entered aircraft and seated without any welcome or support. Food started was served 90 mins after taking off and as it was after midnight we were informed that no dinner would be available, just snacks. Drinks were rare. Later on no one helped me to put mattress. I hope this flight was just an accident.",unexpected disappointment
All Nippon Airways,"New York JFK to Kuala Lumpur via Tokyo Haneda. ANA is the best airline I've ever taken. Wonderful service and staff who are ever ready to serve, and make you feel comfortable. They treat you with kindness - adult and child alike. This is my second time flying with ANA. They ensure that the long journey need not be dreadful with their wonderful staff, good fresh food and clean, well-maintained aircraft.",best airline I've ever taken
All Nippon Airways,"Houston to Tokyo Narita. A rather old aircraft with worn out seats. Still a fantastic 1x2x1 business class seat configuration, with top quality food and service, unbeatable ANA. Wines were not very interesting. The flight was late, and connection became stressful.",top quality food and service
All Nippon Airways,"Tokyo Haneda to New York JFK. As Senator member of Lufthansa I was choosing ANA because of its Star Alliance membership. Overall the experience was rather good. ANA flies an up to date aircraft to New York with the configuration of business class that gives every passanger an isle access, a small table with storing facilities as well as a full flat bed with pillow and cover. The privacy is quite good above all if you choose a window seat with the table towards the aisle. The seat functionality is simple and the comfort pretty good even if the cushions are a bit hard. Food on board is good and the servings are just right so that you don't feel overly stuffed. Wine selections are good as well. On the downside the entertainment program which is extremely limited and not varied enough for non Asian costumers. The service onboard is very good in a japanese style. The flight attendants (almost always women) are very kind and attentive and tend to your every need. I would definitely chose ANA again as it is a much more comfortable option to fly from Japan to the US, although it is also more expensive than the american carriers.",service onboard is very good
All Nippon Airways,"Tokyo Haneda to London return in First class. Exceptional experience, and what a difference to British Airways that I have used for last 2 years. ANA provided true 5 star service, a fabulous suite / bed with proper foam mattress enhancer and nice amenities. Food some of the best I have enjoyed in recent years. Cabin staff exemplary - polite, efficient and above all they seemed to care about looking after customers and very attentive whilst discreet. At Tokyo Haneda the ANA Suite lounge is also fabulous - nice food, service and private cubicle suites to relax and work.",true 5 star service
All Nippon Airways,"Mumbai to Tokyo Narita with ANA in a B787 configured in only two classes. Cabin interior was welcoming and immaculately maintained. The Business Class configuration is among the best, allowing for a degree of privacy not offered in most other airlines. Service levels were exceptional strengthening ANA's reputation as one of the top 5 airlines in the world. The flight attendants were attentive yet discreet. All I can say is, flying with ANA in Business is a pleasure.",service levels exceptional
All Nippon Airways,"Flight NH105 departs from LAX / Tom Bradley around midnight which is pretty convenient because it will arrive very early to Haneda Airport near central Tokyo (note that Narita, the other Tokyo airport is in Chiba Prefecture). One of the best things to enjoy in ANA business class is food, and of course the great selection of wines. As this is a midnight flight only a very light meal after take off and breakfast before landing are served. So don't expect full courses or appetizers as in other daylight flights. Seats for this business class are 1x2x1 and I would say that seats in A and K sides (windows) are the best in terms of privacy for passengers. Every seat has a very good space for personal items and as in other airlines seats are flat when they are totally reclined. As per normal flight attendants service is great and ground staff in LAX as well as Haneda is very efficient. Flight entertainment could be better. Wifi connectivity is good, very affordable rates.",attendants service is great
All Nippon Airways,"NH00O6 departs from Tokyo around 4.30pm and arrives at Tom Bradley in LAX at 11.30 aprox. The arrival time is great since immigration counters are not that busy at that particular time. Seats are comfortable, maybe not as great as business but still ok for this long flight. I wish the footrest would elevate more. Althought the pitch between seats is bigger than in plain economy they affect the space of the passenger behind when recline. The food had two nice choices and the selection of wines was very good. Service with ANA is great so nothing to complain about. Ground service in Tokyo as well in LAX was very good. Baggage was delivered without delay. Ask for baggage check through if traveling in another Star Alliance carrier even you don't have the other leg of your trip in the same ticket. Flight entertainment could be better.",nothing to complain about
All Nippon Airways,"Houston to Tokyo Narita with ANA. I was highly impressed! Second time flying ANA and loved it as much if not more than the first time! I actually had the privilege to fly on one of the Star Wars themed jets and it was amazing. Flight Attendants are very accommodating. I booked thru code share United using mileage plus points and changed my flight last minute, less than 24 hours before. I was therefore unable to select my meal preference in which I am a vegetarian. FA's had no issue with that and went above and beyond to accommodate me, which I truly appreciate. Ive been on other airlines where I felt scolded that I didnt make my selection on time and honestly there are some of us who book flights less than 24 hours prior and even on the day of. Anyway, the flight was delayed maybe 20 minutes but they boarded in a timely fashion and got us up in the air in no time, we landed on time as well. We received two meals and a snack along with suffice beverages included free alcohol - at or a little above average airplane food. InFlight entertainment is kind of lacking some titles. I think there were very limited options especially when doing a round trip. I pretty much saw all the movies going leaving me watching movies over for a second time on the way back. Actually tried some foreign movies with subtitles on the way back but might not necessarily be everyones thing. We all received a Star Wars card thanking us and saying that we flew the star wars aircraft which I thought was cool! Overall, I highly recommend ANA and would place it in my top 10 thus far!",I highly recommend ANA
All Nippon Airways,"Flew ANA from Los Angeles to Narita to Shenyang and return. One passenger was booked using UA miles. One passenger was on paid ticket. Had trouble paying using a US credit card, then switched to a debit card the payment went through. Aircraft was clean, flight attendants are helpful and friendly. Passengers were very quiet in cabin. Boarding process was very quick. Food service were excellent. Seat pitch was 34 inches which was critical to stretch legs, better than most of 31-32 inches seats on most of the airlines.",flight attendants helpful and friendly
All Nippon Airways,"Booked a trip from Austin to Malaysia via Narita from United / ANA and had the worst experience. I was forced to run around Narita airport for nearly 2 hours. I was stopped at the transit check point in Narita as airport security said the tripod I was carrying was longer than their allowed measurement and was considered security item so I couldn't hand carry it. It wasn't even an issue when I was passing through the US immigration and there wasn't even warning about these dimension restriction when I got my tickets. I don't mind not hand carrying it but ANA staff had me check out from the immigration, go to the check in counter to check in my tripod, then go thru the immigration again. The airport was filled and badly ventilated. I didn't even get to enjoy my lounge experience, was drench in sweat and had to run to the gate as the gate was about to close. The staff could have just checked my tripod at my gate which would have saved me all the hassle from running thru the immigration checkpoints. Such a non-practical protocol that they have just irks and zaps all the previous good experience I had towards them. And having done this to a Premier 1K and Gold Alliance customer says a lot about their service.",non-practical protocol
All Nippon Airways,"Trip Routing - Manila - Haneda - Vancouver - May 2016. ANA Deserves their 5 star rating. Manila airport Terminal 3 is a bit chaotic but check in line moves quickly and agents are fast and efficient. The true experience begins when you are greeted at the aircraft door by the wonderful flight attendants. The Japanese have mastered the art of Customer Service. FA's are friendly, courteous and with smile that never goes away. Meal service is very efficient as they show in pictures what is being served and all you need to do is point and comes your hot, delicious and well presented meal. On my longer leg, HND-YVR, 2 meal services were offered and there's an in-between snack and drink service all the time. FA's are seen throughout the entire flights. FA's walking up and down the aisle checking on every awake passenger and offering drinks or food. FA's are also on standby in the back area galley and awaiting for any passenger call. I know this because I get up almost every hour to stretch and FA's never failed to ask me if I needed anything. Economy Seats are comfortable and legroom is sufficient. Aircraft is clean and smells fresh.",meal service is very efficient
All Nippon Airways,"Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo Narita was the first time me, my wife, and daughter have ever flown on ANA, and we were left impressed with the airline. Everyone from the check-in counter staff, ground staff, and cabin crew were super friendly, efficient, and helpful throughout the whole trip. Onboard, the seats were quite comfortable and spacious, compared to seats on other A380's and B787's. Food was served fast, heated, and tasty. IFE was very user-friendly and had enough entertainment for the 7hr journey. Flight crew were checking on us and our child and always on hand to help. Plane was very clean and loved the Boeing 787. Only slight complaint was how the plane was parked away from the terminal, instead of gates and how we needed to take a 5 minute shuttle bus to Narita Terminal 1. Will definitely recommend ANA and opt to fly with them again in the future.",impressed with the airline
All Nippon Airways,"San Francisco to Bangkok via Tokyo. The inflight entertainment wasn't the best for the SFO to NRT hour flight, and of course was the same from Tokyo Narita to Bangkok flight.  The vegetarian (lacto ovo) meal was awful. However, the service from the staff was outstanding. The price was great (booked via united airlines), but would hesitate to fly this airline again. Seats were of average comfort, and seat pitch was great on the Boeing 777-300, not so much on the Boeing 777-200.",the staff was outstanding
All Nippon Airways,"Easy check-in at Singapore with ANA All Nippon Airways for flight from Singapore to Los Angeles via Narita. Singapore Lounge not fully open when I arrived - after about 30 minutes they began to put out food - all cold - steam tables warm it up. Security done at the gate went well. Boarding orderly. Nice seat room and polite and friendly cabin staff. Breakfast was just OK (western option) - pre-arrival snack very nice. Arrived early at NRT and lounge was very close to the gates. When I arrived the lounge was virtually empty, with little in the way of food offerings. After about 40 minutes staff began to put more food out. As the afternoon progressed the lounge became very full - but seats were available and additional food offerings available. Boarding for NRT-LAX flight reasonably smooth. Meal choices were interesting and well presented. Strange that cocktails not served with nuts or nibbles. Movie selection good and was able to get some rest. Pre-arrival breakfast (Asian option) was nice. Bathrooms kept very tidy. Only suggestion is to improve the food offerings.",polite and friendly cabin staff
Emirates,"Our BKK-DXB flight was delayed for 18 hours and as a result we missed our DXB WAW connecting flight. We were offered a long flight with one more transfer DXX-LJU - WAW no longer on Emirates and FlyDubai on budget airlines where the standard was far below expectations. Unfortunately, because of Emirates we also missed the next transfer and instead of 16 hours our journey lasted over 60 hours. The worst thing is that the Emirates hotline showed no interest in our problems. We personally had to nervously look for connections to WAW. I filed a complaint, but Emirates did not respond. They awarded bonus miles instead, but I never want to use Emirates again. It is certainly not a premium airline which shows absolutely no interest to problems of their passengers and to their misconduct. I feel robbed. If I had been focused on low price, not taking service / comfort / time of journey, I would have chosen some different airline paying less. Yet, I paid much, much more and I got absolutely long journey, poor service, absolute disrespect from Emirates hotline, and no refund. They gave me worthless bonus miles. Never again am I going to fly with Emirates - budget airlines seem to be a better option with lower prices",certainly not a premium airline
Emirates,Definitely not the standard I would expect from a premium airline. Business class seats and layout are dated and service levels at gates and checking in are well below other competitors. The economy class is well below Qatar Airways too. Counter staff are unhelpful especially at the UK counters. I would have been better off trying Saudia instead. This is definitely not the experience of Emirates that I have had over 10 years ago. Qatar Airways really puts them to shame.,Qatar Airways really puts them to shame
Emirates,"My husband and I bought tickets to do Paris Seychelles transit Dubai. On arrival in Seychelles my suitcase was not delivered to us. We wait 25 minutes. And at the end of that time, a plastic bag arrives closed with a ribbon into which a quarter of my remaining belongings are thrown. Everything else was stolen. The suitcase was therefore opened despite an empty padlock and the rest of my belongings stashed in a plastic bag. I immediately opened a dispute, sending 37 emails since January 6. I called every two days, no one answered me. I only received automatic emails, with zero follow-up concerning me. I therefore lost more than €6,000 in business, not including the round trip to Paris Seychelles. Unacceptable treatment of customers. Nous avons acheté Mon Mari et moi des billets pour faire Paris Seychelles transit Dubaï. À l’arrivée aux Seychelles ma valise ne nous est pas livré. Nous attendons 25 minutes. Et au bout de ce temps-là, arrive un sac plastique fermé par un ruban dans lequel sont jetés un quart de mes affaires Qui restait. Tout le reste a été volé. La valise a donc été ouverte malgré un cadenas vidé et le reste de mes affaires planqué dans un sac en plastique. J’ai immédiatement ouvert un litige, envoyer 37 mails depuis le 6 janvier. J’ai appelé tous les deux jours, personne ne m’a répondu. Je n’ai que reçu des mails automatiques, Avec zéro suivi me concernant. J’ai perdu donc plus de 6000 € d’affaires, sans compter l’aller-retour, Paris Seychelles. Inadmissible le traitement des clients.",Unacceptable treatment of customers
Emirates,"Every step of the travel, I found harassment, terrible customer support, and absolutely no help. I am treated like an economy class customer in all aspects. Check-in: 1. Rude arrogant check in staff at SFO: refused to accommodate a box that exceeded 59 inches though far underweight than half of 70 kgs allowed. Arrogant staff refused to ever entertain my request as the app clearly mentioned that I could take up to 115 inches, without mentioning additional cost over 59 inches. 2. Reached DXB. At the gate, someone came over with my name and he was not aware of hotel option despite mentioning that I received it in my last trip. When I finally approach Terminal 3 First class lounge, they gave me hotel voucher after a lot of time. Even lounge front desk didn't have that information. 3. The lounge front desk refused to help me get to chauffeur service, didn't tell me 'EXACT' steps on how to reach Arrivals. It was the most terrible experience for someone going there for the first time. The desk that manages Chauffer service was incompetent and provided inaccurate gate info where I could get car to hotel. All this exercise took 1.5 hours, eating up on my plans to go out to the city. 4. When I checked back in the following day, 27th Feb, the second bag was not loaded despite being first class, despite paying for it and despite 19 hours of transit. When I landed and waited for it at carousel, app displayed delayed bag with PIR info. 5. Apparently the customer service agents pretended that they cannot get my contact details to update the baggage claim report/PIR and kept blaming me for it. They knew the flight I was in, the bag number and access to my profile, but kept saying that they can't update me because I didn't provide phone number and email address, both were there in my Emirates profile long before my travel date. 6. No communication on missed bag despite repeated contacts with customer support. Emirates has provided the worst travel experience all around in spite of paying for first class and for additional baggage. This is my last trip with Emirates and request everyone to not waste their money/miles on Emirates. You will always hit a wall in getting somethin we think is customer service. There will be no help, no customer support, no sensitivity or understanding. All I experienced is arrogant highhandedness, no respect for customers.",“the most terrible experience”
Emirates,"Booked flight on Emirates website but first part of journey was from regional Australia with Qantas flight. Luggage checked all way through to Dubai so did not have to transfer it at Brisbane. Checked in on line and when arrived in Brisbane the customer service was very good allowing us to change seats to back of plane as was not a full flight so had 3 seats for 2 passengers, a very comfortable flight and the cabin crew bringing around drinks between meal service. Arrived Safely in Dubai on time.",a very comfortable flight
Emirates,"First time i have lost my baggage after arrival and the help was next to nothing. 1 out of my 2 baggage was missing after we have arrived in Singapore airport. After waiting at the belt and asking a member of staff at the airport then we have found out that this baggage tag was no scanned at my transfer in Dubai. therefore the baggage was somewhere in Dubai not knowing if it has been identified or lost yet. The airport team gave me a Reference and told me that they will keep me updated. i asked for a number to call to the airport office and they provided a number on the form. Next day called the number it was a switch board and after multiple attempts and speaking to the agent you cannot transfer to the airport counter and they do not know anything They tell you that someone will be in touch but that is not true. The customer service helpline on Emirates website is useless as you cannot get through or speak to a real person for help. I had no idea the next couple of days where my luggage was or if it is lost? No communication what so ever throughout, multiple emails/ calls/ feedback to emirates but no response. The customer affair team takes 9 months to even reply. i have another outstanding experience in April 2023 from Tokyo to Manchester where of on my luggage was smashed and they have not offered any compensation but asked me to to go a repair centre for a quote after 8 months of the incident. Took them 8 months to acknowledge my claim and probably made 20 phone calls to change after multiple email. They have the worse customer service if you was to encounter a problem or issue.",not offered any compensation
Emirates,"My Emirates experience was horrific, starting at Delhi airport where ground staff threatened to deny boarding unless I forced my laptop into my carry-on.  Boarding pass retrieval led to another confrontation at the gate. Emirates staff at the gate confiscated my boarding passes, threatened baggage offloading, and harassed me for carrying my laptop bag separately. Only after pledging to stow my laptop bag under my seat was I allowed to board just before departure. Upon reaching LA, I discovered a missing bag. It took days for Emirates to locate it. Emirates staff, without notice or gate codes, knocked at midnight, delivering my damaged bag. How they accessed it remains a mystery. The bag was torn, belongings damaged, and some items were missing. Despite three complaints, Emirates provided no response. Despite reaching out multiple times, Emirates offered no explanations, leaving me frustrated and dissatisfied with their customer service.",Emirates experience was horrific
Emirates,"This was my first trip on Emirates. I paid $1,400 for my economy ticket. I also paid to select my seats. I specifically chose an aisle seat because I have neuropathy and needed to ensure I could stand up regularly to avoid blood clots & not disturb others. Immediately, I noticed the man sitting next to me, sharing an armrest with me, that he dominated, was sniffing and digging hard up his nose every couple of minutes nonstop. He would then touch everything around us, including the armrest. Each time he dug up his nose, he would grab the armrest that we shared in common. He also put his hand on my side and touched the screen, picked up something that fell and handed it to me. He was openly digging up his nose and touching everything while sniffing, indicating sickness. I was wearing a mask. He was not. I was entirely grossed out and very concerned for my health and safety. It was not a one time act, but a continuing behavior, every few minutes. I told attendants to observe his conduct too. The flight was over 12 hours long and I could not stomach this nasty behavior the long flight and risk my fragile health and safety sitting next to this man, imagine trying to eat next to him. I spoke to the flight attendants a minimum of three different times. Their eventual solution was to move me from my seat up front to the very back of the airplane, far from my colleagues. I was traveling with three companions, two sitting in front of me and one in first class. Our paid seats were the first seats behind economy preferred class. There were dozens of available seats in that section that were close to my companions and only a few feet away from the section I was sitting in that I paid for. Rather than make my health a priority and move me to a safer section, they attempted to move me to the very back of the plane. They said they couldn't say anything to the man. I didn't want to leave my companions. It was so frequent that I took evidence the entire flight to prove it. The only time he used a napkin was when they served food, and he used the one from his tray to clean his nose. That is the napkin he dropped on me, reaching over me to the stewardess. It was their jobs to help keep me safe. I was content in the seat I purchased near the front, on the aisle. I wasn't seeking to be upgraded. But if those were the only seats available, in close proximity to the seat I purchased, and still near my companions; rather than make me sit over 12 hours stressed out trying to avoid bodily fluids; put at a health & safety risk sitting next to a man openly wiping his bodily fluids on my seat, the armrest & me, they should have moved me to those seats, not the back of the plane.",“attempted to move me to the back of the plane”
Emirates,"Check in desk at Montreal airport going to Philippines: We were traveling as a family with my senior mom, my wife and my infant that was 11months old. We did our check in online and made sure we chose a bulkhead seat to be able to use the basinet. To our surprise when we got to the plane they have changed our seats without letting us know. Very inconvenient and stressful since we where counting on those seats. The explanation they gave to us was that when there is a change of the type of plane they can not guarantee the seats we chose. I believe thats not a good reason to give and is a sorry excuse. If there is a change of any sort they have the responsibility to let us know I would have been glad to pay for a better seat. Morever, our return flight was even worst. At the checkein gate right before boarding,from Dubai to Montreal, they told us that we needed to check-in our carryon bags since there was no space on the overhead storage due to full capacity. We told them that we can not do so since we have an infant with us and that the carry on and baby diaper bags where a must, plus her toys,formula and food etc. They still refuse and told us we needed to check in our carry on. We were within what we were allowed to bring to the plane and still we needed to check in our things. I find this ridiculous. They do not meet the product that they are offering or selling and they have no sence of transparency at this point and a sense of understanding the situation we were in. The staff also was rude and just ignored my concerns. Not a family friendly airline thats for sure. Food and entertainment: horrible and tastless and the 2 planes going back from philippines to Dubai and transit then to Montreal my entertainement screen were broken. Staff in the plane I can clearly see that they do their best but are sometime not found when you need them, especially in a long haul flight when everyone is sleeping.

Emirates,"I have just completed a trip Johannesburg to Dallas via Dubai, returning from LAX, and cannot fault them in any way. All flights were on time, staffed by efficient, courteous staff and seats were extremely comfortable. In addition, the other services afforded by Emirates for Business Class passengers - a) the chauffeur service, which I used twice, and b) the promise of a hotel room if your layover is longer than 6 hours - mine was 9 hours - worked extremely efficiently, and I was housed at a top class hotel.",cannot fault them

It worked on the first leg of my trip (Manila to Dubai) but it didnt work at all on the 2nd leg (Dubai to Washington Dulles - 14 hours). This route to the US is longer than the Pacific route but I booked it precisely because it offered paid internet. Unluckily, the internet did not work on the longest leg. I filed a complaint to Emirates and they said that it is really not their problem and I should file a complaint to their internet service provider.",“internet did not work on the longest leg”
Emirates,The seat pockets were ripped and I was unable to store anything. When I used the tray my drink slid off bec the tray was unstable.

Emirates,"Lately it's not enjoyable travelling economy with Emirates. The boarding areas are too small with standing too only for many, the toilets on the flights are dirty, the food is average and the seats are cramped. Earphones don't work, choice of movies has become limited. On top of that, the last two flights, they have changed the legroom seats I paid Extra for for standard seats. On complaining, I was told to ask for a refund on my return. No compensation, no upgrade (payable or not). Basically they don't care. Having bought direct and paid £4000 on the tickets 2, it's not really good enough. It's not what it used to be. Economy is now cattle class.",Basically they don't care

Emirates,"I (via a travel agent) booked a round-trip business class flight with Emirates that ended in Queenstown, NZ. Upon arriving for a layover in Melbourne at 23:30 after a 13-hour business class flight from Dubai, I was looking forward to a shower. However, I was denied entry to the Emirates lounge, without any real explanation as to why. The gentleman at the counter was more interested in making me go away than helping me understand the situation, so, confused, I called Emirates customer service. They bluntly informed me that if I wanted to use the lounge so badly, my travel agent should have booked the flight from Melbourne to Queenstown on Qantas. As it turns out, the leg from Melbourne to Queenstown that I had was on Emirates partner Jetstar. As Jetstar does not have a business class cabin, this one leg (out of 5 total legs) was economy. I should note that the entire itinerary was booked through Emirates, and part of my confusion stemmed from the fact that they all had Emirates flight numbers. But what I had here was an Emirates flight operated by Jetstar (and the same flight also had a Qantas flight number - one flight, three partners, three numbers). I should have gotten the Emirates flight operated by Qantas that was departing an hour later, as Qantas has a business class cabin, and it would have been the same cost anyway. If it's the same cost anyway, why not let me come in and take a shower? It's 1am and there is no one else here. Additionally, they do not care if the arriving flight is business, or if 4/5 legs are business, you are not special. No kindness, no attempts at understanding or helpfulness or smoothing over the situation. Just rudeness and criticism. A jarring and unpleasant surprise.",Just rudeness and criticism

Emirates,"I was travelling to Tokyo Narita via Dubai. In 2022 I had the meal issues on return journey from NRT To DXB when they could only offer a meal with items I have bad allergies to, Then second meal Cabin Crew forgot to offer, wouldn't give any water on 12.5 hour flight. for the recent one I contacted Emirates Customer Service that I have allergies for fish, mushroom and wholemeal, Customer service rep said bring your own food then and the crew will heat them up I said it will be taken off me at security at Glasgow if not Dubai he said no, the day came food was taken off me at Security at Glasgow. As backup they booked me a bland meal that wouldn't contain my allergies on DXB to NRT section (GLA-DXB meals were fine) which was Mushroom and second meal fish and mushroom. Which meant no food just a tiny bottle of water. I'm already worried about the return flights and worries were confirmed when once again meals offered with allergy items, Cabin crew I'll give credit concerned, very little food and water. Not just that my seat was broke, headphones broke and the so called ICE entertainment system wouldn't work, 12 hours nothing to do and crew couldn't move as they already moved others with similar problem, couldn't move myself. I recently got a response from Customer Service out of their control and one the flight cabin also said they would have refused the my own food and I wouldn't have gotten anything through Dubai for second flight. 2024 and 2025 holidays won't be with Emirates.

Emirates,"I was compelled to write a review for an airline because of the exceptional service I got from the whole team of the cabin crew. It was more of a great experience rather than a journey. Right from the entrance to the aircraft I was treated like a beloved family member who came to see the family after years by every staff member. Every single request was taken seriously and was addressed to the best of the availability. I felt that I was the only special passenger for them, they were super nice and highly empathetic in their body language. The air hostess assigned to my area was asking me every single time she passed by me with a great smile if all was good. When you enter the lounge you are greeted with super smiles, if you ask them something they come close to you holding shoulders to show attachment. They were all super devoted to their work, full of energy and trying to help everyone as much they can.

Emirates,"Emirates is always a good choice. Comfortable seats with a large seat pitch and good entertainment program. The on-board catering is good and sufficient. Check-in was extremely quick and the flight was on time. Only the on-board staff seemed annoyed on all flights and, accordingly, the speed and type of service was somewhat disappointing. The ticket prices are high but for a good airline worse to pay.",“Comfortable seats”
Emirates,This was a short but wonderful fifth freedom ride with Emirates. Despite the fairly short (just under 3 hours) flight Emirates was at the top of their game. Most of what I experienced has been documented many times but the personalized service I received was notable. A delicious meal was artfully served and no request was too much for the crew.

Seats relatively comfortable and cabin service OK but struggled to find something interesting to watch on IFE on all 4 sectors - that's why I always travel with a book - although watching Newcastle Utd hammer PSG at St James' Park live was a bonus on BNE-DXB sector. Unfortunately there was no wifi or live TV coverage on DXB-BNE return sector for which the crew apologised before departing DXB. Relatively uneventful flights that arrived & departed pretty much on time other than a 1hr delay on take off from DXB on final leg - pushed back from gate on time but held on ground for an hour due to ATC traffic. Emirates actually provide a good one stop service from the east coast of Australia to Europe but the 14hr legs to & from DXB can be a struggle.

Emirates,"I couldn’t get a business saver so had to opt for more expensive business flex flight. I needed to book in August to use my airmiles. Lo and behold the saver tickets were released a week later making the price £600 cheaper. Emirates refuse to help, their excuse was all these people of 8 different flights had cancelled, therefore making the business saver available! It’s price rigging.

However, they won’t change to one row before which 17 because all they care is selling the seats instead of passenger’s convenience. Also during 50 mins of turbulence they only allow business class passengers use the toilet and the whole economic class passengers were not allowed. Only BC PAXs have the skill to protect themself during turbulence and EC PAXs can’t do it? I wrote a complaints and they responded that I have accepted the alternative seat but actually I went to original seat which the screen was broken (including call button).

Emirates,"First I was separated from my wife of 35 years and then despite my plea of a stiff shoulder I was given a window seat in all my 42 years of flying. Emirates seem to treat its tour group passengers as 2nd class passengers without any rights. My wife and I flew to Spain and Portugal from Singapore on a packaged tour with a travel group. On our return flights first from Madrid to Dubai on EK142 on 9 Oct 2023 and from Dubai to Singapore on EK 354 on 10 Oct 2023, my wife and I were placed on window seats on the opposite sides of the aircraft. When I enquired at the check in counter for an aisle seat for the 2 flights as I am a tall bloke with a stiff shoulder (which has been affecting me for the past 5 years), the staff gave me an aisle seat further back and my wife in a window seat 6 rows ahead. She said she tried but could not see the connecting flight seating plan from Dubai to Singapore and advised me to approach the boarding gate in Dubai for help. When we reached Dubai, the tour manager, my wife and I, another another couple who had been in opposite ends of the aircraft made a beeline for the connecting help desk close to B18 boarding gate. The guard refused to let us into the queue even though there was no one queuing and the 2 counter staff were helping a couple of the passengers at the counter. He told us to use the self-help kiosk computer even though we said we needed help with changing the seats. The computer did not do the latter and directed back to the counter. The guard was still reluctant and finally allowed my wife and I in the queue. However, our tour manager and the couple were kept outside the line even though they had legitimate business to speak to someone at the counter. There was a couple talking to a group of the staff outside the counter near the queue and the man was gesticulating wildly in a heated discussion with the staff. Eventually one of the staff involved in the 'conversation' told the guard to admit all of us and 'royally allowed' us to talk to him behind the counter. He told us in no uncertain terms that we were given our seats as 'non-paying' passengers and it was tough luck that we had to be separated. Our tour manager protested that the tour passenger list with familial/partnering connections was given to the airline beforehand but he said we were given a block of seats from rows 81 to 83 and he could not help in any way. My question to the airline is this: if the passenger list has been provided with the different familial/partnering groupings could it not be more accommodating and doing a slipshod job of seating willy nilly without regard for the families and couples travelling together. What happens if there are families with young children? Furthermore if the airline has given a block of seats (say rows 61 to 63 or 81 to 83 and not all window seats or not all middle seats) in advance why can't it have the good sense to pass them on the tour manager beforehand so the tour manager can help to allocate the seats according to the passengers' preference and needs? Even in times of profit squeeze when corporations try to extract every cent from its passengers, how much money can you make to justify discriminating and alienating your passengers just because the 25 of them are travelling as part of a package tour?",discriminating and alienating your passengers
Emirates,"I wish to express my dissatisfaction with my recent experience on Emirates Flight EK2185, scheduled for August 6th, 2023, from Dubai to Catania. The flight was canceled less than 24 hours in advance, which severely impacted my long-haul trip. This trip was booked through the Emirates website and was disrupted just hours before its departure due to the cited 'unforeseen circumstances,' namely a fire at Catania Airport, which had occurred three weeks prior. Being an aware passenger, I was cognizant of the previous flight cancellations to Catania and the airport's incapacity to handle extra-Schengen flights. Consequently, I had been diligently monitoring the situation, investing significant time and financial resources from a remote location in South Africa to stay updated and explore alternative travel options in case of an eventual cancellation. My distressing experience began when I found myself caught in a bureaucratic game of ping-pong between Emirates and Flydubai, the airline operating the flight. Both carriers appeared to evade responsibility and failed to offer me any practical alternative plans. The cancellation notification reached me while I was en route to the airport, necessitating an unscheduled stop in an area with phone reception to contact the Emirates call center, as per Flydubai's app recommendation. To my dismay, I spent over 30 minutes on the phone only to discover that Emirates was not presenting any viable options for reaching my final destination. Furthermore, their communication regarding alternative flights from Dubai to Italy was initially unclear—mentioning Rome or Milan—and later, limited to Naples, with no apparent connection to Catania. It was only after a protracted discussion that the call-center operator finally intervened, reconfiguring my entire reservation to a flight bound for Milan, just an hour before my scheduled check-in at Skukuza. This change, which was seemingly necessitated by Emirates' arcane policies, left me in Dubai without compensation for the additional time spent there. I was accommodated in a shared room with no meals, a circumstance that I managed to secure solely because my partner already had a reservation for a Dubai Connect service. Following the call-center operator's instructions, I had to personally book a new flight from Milan to Catania, incurring additional expenses. The overwhelming stress and uncertainty surrounding this ordeal marred a significant portion of my holiday experience. I requested that Emirates recognized the hardships I endured during this journey, including the extra costs incurred due to the days of delay and the missed medical appointment. However, they just said they could do nothing.",express my dissatisfaction
Emirates,"I was checking in at Counter F1 at KLIA T1, served by your ground staff, Ms Farah around 8.35am to get on EK345 from KL to Dubai.

I was shocked and told her I've got a confirmation email that seat 32A was allocated to me (yes, I booked for it in advance using Trip.com). She said it's a 3rd party confirmation and I was supposed to online check in. Gosh... that was ridiculous! You mean an email confirmation is not a confirmation? Fine. I told her I do not mind an aisle seat instead but do not put me in the middle. She made a call and ended up telling me that it cannot be done.

I have had no reason to complain, previously about Emirates’ service. Sitting in seat 30F, I had ordered vegetarian food, and received a snack soon after take-off, along with a sealed cup of water. Subsequently, meals for other passengers were brought round and people were offered drinks, but I was offered nothing, and the steward moved on too quickly for me to request a drink. At the next opportunity, when a steward passed by, I requested a drink, but was advised to wait until lunch was served (a very poor response, I felt). I reiterated: I would like a drink as soon as possible (as I was thirsty). The person in seat 30G was asleep and I could not exit the seat with causing a disturbance. A drink was subsequently provided (but over 15 minutes later). However, the table in 30F is/was not secure and the drink slid off, spilled over me and the person in 30G next to me. The people sitting either side of me were more helpful than the steward in trying to clear up the mess. Later on, lunch did arrive, but it was 2 hours after I had first requested a drink (so, my request for a drink had been vindicated). When food trays were later collected, mine was overlooked, the steward passed me by, and my food tray was left for over half an hour. When a steward passed by, I asked that the tray be removed and could not understand why I was being treated in what seemed a negligent manner. At this point, I was beginning to become very fed up. A supervisor later came round and asked if I was alright. I was fine (albeit tired), but frustrated at having been ignored and overlooked. The supervisor was firm, but unapologetic, and asked me if I needed anything. I did not need anything, and she left me without further comment, her enquiry appearing pointless to me, as it solved nothing. Following this experience, I am unlikely to use Emirates again, which has left me thoroughly disillusioned with the company.",ignored and overlooked
Emirates,What a nightmare. Taken back to the stand and kept on the plane for 2 hours in sweltering heat with little refreshment and terrible communication from the pilot and staff on board about the fault and when it will be fixed. Absolutely pathetic customer service - it’s like torture on the plane. Stay away from this airline - they do not look after you when there is a problem.,Stay away from this airline
Emirates,"I made a single reservation with Emirates to fly from Milan to Botswana, via Dubai and Johannesburg. The two flights to and from Botswana were operated by other airlines. On my way to Botswana I made a transit in Dubai and a transit in Johannesburg. On my way back things went bad. We arrived at the airport in Botswana (Maun) and the flight we booked on the Emirates website, was not present. We asked and found out that it had been replaced by another flight, operated by a different airline, at a different time. We checked in for this new flight and found out that no transit was possible in Johannesburg. Therefore we had to go through immigration, retrieve our luggage, queue again for the check in, pass security and passport control to get on our next flight to Dubai. To me it's unbelievable that Emirates did not care to inform us about the flight change and the fact that we could not make a normal transit, like on the first part of our journey. It's a pity because the flight experience has been good, with very nice crew and operating on time.",no transit was possible in Johannesburg
Emirates,"The return journey from HKG to BKK reaffirmed the low quality of the airline that I experienced on the outward journey. Added to that however, was the 50 minutes to queue in the Online Check-in, having arrived at the airport more than the recommended 3 hours before flight departure. This is presumably as a result of only 2 check-in counters open for Online check-in. 2 were available for those who had not checked in, and these seemed to move more quickly. Once through, and with enough time to grab a bite at the airport, the greeting on board was initially friendly, but then the surly attitude of any staff with whom I came into any brief contact, (one, who removed my light hand luggage with laptop, to accommodate a passenger at the Emergency Exit, who's steamer trunk hand luggage could not fit into the overhead luggage bin above his seat, (which Emirates call hat rack; if only). I had heard Emirates were the best on offer in this post pandemic era, but if that is the case, the standard must be extremely low. So low, a low-cost airline would make more sense. As I had eaten before departure, I was able to avoid the food service, and had brought a bottle of water with me, so I did not have to endure the chaotic and illogical F&B service, with its dire offerings.",reaffirmed the low quality of the airline
Emirates,"In order to mitigate the inordinately inflated prices of Business Class fares, I chose Economy for the first time. Not having much experience of this, I read reviews that Emirates were the best choice for this route BKK-HKG over the usual well established carrier for this route. The service was perfunctory at best. My expectations were low regarding most aspects of the flight, and I was not disappointed, but I had read that service was good quality with pleasant staff. I had zero example of this. Food was delivered haphazardly, and as I had not eaten by the time of take off at 14.05, I ate what was on offer. My low expectations were not disappointed. Anyway, my small experiment with Emirates and Economy are over.",“service was perfunctory at best”
Emirates,I was very very disappointed by the service of the cabin crew. I flew to Mauritius on 21.7.23 with my family and flew back to Glasgow on 18. 08.23. Food service were very poor. The cabin crews took all their times to serve the foods. Some passengers are served first then after hours the rest of the passengers are served. They also served the beverages or the drinks late after the meals. Me and families never got a drink or any beverage at all. I phoned the crews so many times but they never attended us. When I complained to the crew she apologised and promised to bring us some drinks but she never appeared. On our way from Mauritius to dubai in flight EK 704 we got seats which were close to the toilet the floor was wet because of leak. Inform the crew and they took ages to bring a blanket to cover the floor. During the flights the cabin crews supposed to served drinks water or juice but they didn't. They look disinterested to provide a good service. They pulled the curtain so that you can't see them and they themselves eating and drinking. A lots have changed. I wonder where the drinks wines and whiskey are going which are supposed to serve to the passengers. Worst service. I already binned my boarding pass but I remembered seating in zone E 61E.,very disappointed by the service
Emirates,"I am writing to express my disappointment with Emirates Flight EK0243. Despite meticulously tagging our luggage, we were charged an additional $110 by Emirates for inter-baggage transfer. Regrettably, our baggage has been stranded in Dubai for five days. This situation has left us without essentials and with a complete lack of communication or assistance from Emirates. This experience has shaken our trust in the airline's service quality.",shaken our trust in service quality
Emirates,"It was a few years since I had flown Emirates but albeit in Economy, they provided I believed a better service than most other carriers. Well - in my view, lots has changed with Emirates in the last few years and I believe Quality has become Quantity unless possibly if you are flying Premium or Business. Despite being very polite, ground staff appeared disinterested in assisting for an upgrade both in Durban & Dubai and even their call centre. It was at least 2 hours into the first flight before we had either a drink or food and in 47B by then there was no more food choice. Compared to the other carrier I took south-bound to South Africa, screen on our Emirates B777 to Dubai was old and headphones on both flights uncomfortable. Transfer in Dubai required you are accustomed to your 10,000 steps a day. Sad but per two flights taken, it didn't appear reflective of all the publicity one sees. At least per my own experience on these two flights. Only the A380 was nice and quiet!",lots has changed with Emirates
Emirates,"Flew on Emirates after several years. Impressive economy cabin with very comfortable seats and a little extra leg room. The airline’s warm ambience is soothing. The cabin was very clean and well maintained. Boarding was well managed at the gate. The economy meal options were superb, extra snacks included with the meal were superb. Entertainment excellent with offerings in multiple languages. The staff were very professional.  Perhaps, the attendant serving my zone could have better assisted the passengers with stowing away the carry-ons instead of standing idle and passively greeting. Overall, very evident why Emirates fairs very well in the international flight scene.",Entertainment excellent
Emirates,"I had a First Class Ticket booked with Emirates back in December 2019. I took the outbound flight but the inbound flight was canceled due to Covid-19. Emirates offered a voucher to change my flight for free. However the covid situation was taking too long, I wasn't planning to take any flight before the voucher expired. And then, I requested a refund in July 2023 and got emailed back from Emirates. They confirmed that the refund had been approved to Amex (my original payment card). I contacted Amex 10 working days later, and was told that Amex not received the refund. Amex had to fill a form to raise the case for investigation but they need details on the refund amount. So I contacted Emirates to confirm whether they had refund the ticket or not, and how much was the amount refunded. Emirates representative advised that the other representative was chasing the refund and she refused to tell me any more details, nor give me information on the amount to be refund. I asked to be transfer to the relevant department. She agreed to do so and then hung up the call.",refused to tell me any more details
Emirates,Emirates was a great airline for frequent fliers but has gone downhill the past few years. Many of the perks of being a gold member are gone and in general the staff attitude and competency is very low in comparison. As of July 2023 Emirates gold members cannot use the business class check in which was one of the main advantages leaving DXB.,has gone downhill the past few years
Emirates,"I selected a flight operated by Emirates with a long layover. I was aware that Emirates offers a free layover hotel night if the layover is longer than 8 hours. So, I selected it and paid for it. I qualified for all the criteria including the fact that I booked via Qantas as per the Terms and Conditions stipulated in their website, see here: https://www.emirates.com/english/before-you-fly/dubai-international-airport/dubai-connect/terms-and-conditions/ As stated in the T&C: Both your inbound and outbound flights to and from Dubai must be an Emirates flight (marketed by Qantas or Emirates) or a Qantas flight (marketed by Emirates or Qantas). But now that I want to book the free hotel night, I got the feedback: On reading the last line on the terms and conditions, you see the statement says The ticket must be issued on an Emirates (176) document. This is the base of the reason for denying the service. How unfair and confusing is that for customers?  Super disappointed and I will not book with them in the future.",I will not book with them in the future
Emirates,"The issues I encountered include a significant problem with their cancellation policy, lack of responsiveness from their customer service team, concerning safety practices, refusal to reimburse for damaged luggage, an extensive delay during the return flight, and a stark contrast in service quality between Economy and Business class. Regarding the cancellation policy, I received misleading information from three representatives, who assured me that I would receive a full refund if I canceled within 24 hours. However, they failed to mention the crucial condition that this only applied when the flight was at least 7 days after the initial booking. As a result, I tried to cancel within the 24-hour window but could only reschedule. This cost me a $500 loss vs. the option of cancelling and booking a new flight for the following day. Despite Emirates acknowledging in writing their mistake, they repeatedly refused to provide a price match or refund, and eventually even stopped replying to my follow up messages on the open complain. The lack of responsiveness from Emirates compounded my frustration. Numerous follow-up messages went unanswered, showing a lack of interest in resolving the issues I faced.  During the flight, I was alarmed by a safety practice where all blankets were collected and piled in front of the emergency exits.  Emirates also declined to reimburse me for one of two damaged pieces of luggage, despite the damage occurring during their handling.  Furthermore, the return flight experienced a significant delay for a missing document, resulting in passengers being seated on the plane for over two hours, including boarding time. Despite the delay being just a few minutes short of two hours, the lack of updates, assistance, and provisions such as free Wi-Fi or refreshments left passengers feeling inconvenienced and neglected. The service quality and care for Economy class travelers fall short of expectations.",refusal to reimburse for damaged luggage
Emirates,First the good: flight not full so seat space was more than adequate and very comfortable. Entertainment was excellent as always on Emirates. Now the not so good: meal was barely passable and did not come with a drink which as a diabetic isn't good. Cabin crew were really surly and did not speak coherent English.,Cabin crew were really surly
Emirates,"What a difference a crew makes. Flight from Dubai was staffed by a really engaging crew for whom nothing was too much trouble. Seat was comfortable but you can tell this was one of the older A380 as part were looking a bit worse for wear. Food on this flight was among some of the best I have ever had. Lounge was busy but to be fair we sat close to the gate and didn’t venture in. Boarding was separate to economy however we still had to wait 10 min even though when we tried it was already 10 min past the boarding time. Got the two return legs to go, let’s see if the consistency improves.",let’s see if the consistency improves
Emirates,"The on-board internet simply does not work. If you complain, the supplier for Emirates, 'Sita for Aircraft' simply refuse to acknowledge that they failed to provide a service and issue a refund. It appears from multiple reviews that this happens often. Emirates themselves, apart from the non-existent internet and poor third party after-sales experience were pretty good, ample leg room, friendly staff, good selection of movies but poor food choice - fish or vegetables only. The check-in was also poor. I followed the check in signs for economy seats at Dubai airport T3, waited for around 20-30 mins before being told to check in at desk 5 (flights to USA) - i wasn't flying to the USA, how am i supposed to know to follow that sign? Very poor understanding of the customer journey.",on-board internet simply does not work
Emirates,"I'm writing this review so others won't go through what went through. This airline has no accountability whatsoever. The day of my flight I was denied check in. The reason was that I had less than 6 month validity on my passport which was not required for my destination. The Emirates agent at the check-in booth told me he wouldn't let me on the flight and then offered my seat to a standby client. Because of this I missed my flight, I had to renew my passeport in less than 24h and lost 2 days stay at the hotel. I had to pay 300$+ ticket as penalty to board on the next flight not to mention the psychological distress I was put under (I have depression/anxiety disorder). I was travelling with a group and someone in my group has checked in with no problem with passport validity less than 6 months. When I contacted Emirates for refund they said the agent didn't declare the incident and put me as no show on the system although I was there in time with the group. I was told by Emirates that without the name of the agent they can do nothing about it. In short Emirates agents can freely deny you your flight manipulate the system and sell your seat to another person and you can do nothing about it.",I was denied check in
Emirates,"Very friendly check in staff, same goes for the lounge staff, however there was only one on the front desk, and was tied up selling with upgrades or lounge access which meant that we had a 10 min wait before we got access. Lounge itself was nice and had just been refurbished, how ever food selection was average with several things having run out and not replaced. Flight it’s self was good but due to midnight departure staff were just going through the motions. The beef tenderloin has to be the driest toughest piece of meat to have ever been served on an airplane. Overall I have had better experiences on other carriers. Emirates seems to suffer from hit and miss crew. Plane landed on time and for the price the service was not unreasonable. Still a bit poor that you don’t even get a limited amount of wifi in business class.",Emirates seems to suffer from hit and miss crew
Emirates,"Did a single booking for my family 3 months prior. Still they split the seats for a long haul 16 hour flight from Dubai to Los Angeles. Instead of giving four seat configuration. Never happened before. The folks at gate terminals very unsupportive and not even willing to listen to you. One word is what they say full flight. Would never ever fly back on this. Yes am skywards members as well, but that doesn't help you as well.",not even willing to listen to you
Emirates,"I decided to fly Emirates again after having a very unfortunate first experience with them a few years ago. Well what I can tell now from 4 flights with them is that they are a hit or miss airline. Some crew members will be friendly and professional others on the same flight will be rude and careless. What others have mentioned on these reviews is true, they will run out of meals option easily and you will have to settle with leftovers if you are seated at the rear. I have noticed the aircrafts are becoming very overused, some had broken features and a funny smell. The food is very basic if compared to other premium airlines. I would say Emirates is still a viable option if the price is right and they offer a lot of connections, but they are not my first choice airlines if other middle eastern carriers are in the game.",a hit or miss airline
Emirates,"My family experienced very poor service with Emirates, the issue was with food services, on a 16 hour flight, we get no meal selection, just have to satisfy with leftovers, we were sitting in row 86, 1st time flight attendant says they only have vegetarian meals, ran out of non-vegetarian, the same thing happens at the second meal, also on second time no beverages were served, I had call a flight attendant for beverage service. Not enough time was given to eat our food. May be Emirates would ask customers on their meal preference and stock up accordingly, no beverage services offered at all during the entire flight, we would have to walk up to the service station and ask for water/juice. Hope to see improved services on future Emirates flights.",Hope to see improved services
Emirates,This review is to appreciate the service given by Emirates flying cabin crew Ms Maria during my flight EK648 on 24-06-2023 from DXB to CMB. Her service was exceeding expectation and was supportive at every occasion.,appreciate the service given
Emirates,"I'm motivated to write this critical review after multiple phone-hours with customer service agents with Emirates in the hope that others would benefit (and that Emirates would listen!). We had booked a return flight from/to STL-COK via YYZ and DXB. The first flight from STL to YYZ was by its code share partner Air Canada. Unfortunately, just a couple weeks before our flight, Air Canada changed the flight time such that it was not possible to catch the flight from YYZ to DXB. We reached out to Emirates, our primary booking partner, to rebook and were provided a rerouting option through ORD (Chicago) for an additional $3300 for 3 tickets. Annoyed by this suggestion, we requested to fly Air Canada flight the day before, which was turned down because of unavailability of economy class tickets. Because of lack of viable options, we decided to drop the flight from STL-YYZ but retain the flights from YYZ-DXB and DXB-COK, with the idea of booking our own flights from STL-YYZ. We booked this flight for the day before, so we also had to book overnight stay in YYZ. When we filed a travel claim which needed a certificate of flight delay, Emirates asked me to reach out to Air Canada. Unfortunately, Air Canada had none of our names in their system and it was impossible to reach their customer service for further assistance. In summary, we have spent almost $2800 (flight tickets + overnight stay) for Air Canada/Emirates' incompetence and are unable to get a 'flight delayed' certificate to process our legitimate claim. Please beware when booking flights through Emirates because it takes absolutely NO responsibility for their code share partners' mistakes. All I received were platitudes such as, 'we understand', 'that is awful', etc. over the phone but with no real help to process our claim. Lesson learned and no more Emirates for us ever!",no more Emirates for us ever
Emirates,"Excellent service. I flew Dubai- B'Ham- Dubai in economy class. Emirates has common counters where you can check in your luggage. Initially, I was skeptical (particularly on the DXB-BHX route) but Emirates made no mistakes. This is quite convenient as you can check in quickly and go to the lounge. The flight departed on time, the crew had a smile and were quite professional. Food was sufficient in quantity and quite good with metal cutlery in economy class. There was another snack service followed by juices/hot drinks 1.5 hours before landing. The seating is quite good and has a seat [pitch of 32). B777s in use by Emirates are getting old and you can see the signs. Their ICE system was excellent. I am not sure I would like the Business class seats here as they weren't lie-flat but I was flying economy. Families with kids were well taken care of with flight attendants distributing amenities and offering to take and share instant pictures using Polaroid cameras. The in-flight wifi was free for text messaging using WhatsApp, even in economy if you have Skywards membership. My only complaint during the trip is that the plane was parked far off and required considerable walking at Terminal 3 in Dubai to reach immigration (which was a breeze). Overall, it was a great experience but flights are quite expensive compared to the competition.",a great experience
Emirates,"What a disappointment. Emirates is lauded as having one of the best inflight experiences in the world. They obviously spend a lot of money marketing the experience as such. The problem with this is that expectations are high. The hard product is good, all be it a little tatty. Service and food quality is poor. Options are limited and there is no dining in demand. It’s the first time I’ve flown business and had my meal served on a tray. Never addressed or welcomed by name aside from when my boarding card was presented on entering the aircraft. Crew were polite when you got their attention, but most of the time they were avoiding eye contact when racing through the cabin. I had just come off a Virgin Atlantic upper class flight and while their upper class seats aren’t great, the service blows emirates out of the water. Fly better? Do better!!",What a disappointment
Emirates,"Emirates is an airline that tries to maximize the amount of money that it can squeeze out of customers, whilst providing the minimum possible service. I find them far less flexible than other airlines, will apply every penalty they can regardless of circumstance, and will not let customers know of the complimentary services they provide so you end up paying extra. The counter staff are generally unhelpful and impatient, and the cabin crew are less professional and appear less trained than other airlines. Definitely would NOT recommend flying with Emirates to anyone. I will certainly never fly with them again.",certainly never fly with them again
Emirates,"Every encounter with airline representatives was pleasant and professional. Thank you to Ahmed, who checked me in very early this morning (1:00 am, June 6th), and made sure I was happy with the seating. Also to Zeeshan, who helped me find my way to the lounge, with all its wonderful amenities.  Much gratitude to the female Captain, who flew us smoothly from Dubai to JFK and kept us all well informed about a few delays before takeoff.",pleasant and professional
Emirates,"Birmingham to Dubai, Boeing 777. Hideous aircraft. Noisy and really uncomfortable. However, very good service and delicious food. Emirates are excelling with their food, compared to last year. Dubai to Auckland A380 as good as you will get in economy. Plenty of space, and so quiet in this magnificent aircraft. Service a wee bit patchy. Had a few young, I would say, new staff. However they tried very hard, and everyone has to start somewhere.",excelling with their food
Emirates,"I had the worst experience of my lifetime flying with Emirates. It all started from Thiruvananthapuram where our travel began, food was just pathetic and the service is just awful. Let alone the seats are not even comfortable with hardly any legroom. Sitting on the seat for less than an hour and you feel your bones crushing on the frame of the seat. The flight attendants seem like overly busy even if they were to walk past you and you ask them for a glass of water. The next leg was the long haul. Both my wife and I were just exhausted with the service and the flight attendants wouldn't even get a band aid after I cut myself from hitting my feet on the fasteners of the seat.  We waited for almost an hr after boarding from Dubai to take off and I ended up cutting myself while being seated and I showed my feet to the flight attendant, and she didn't even care to get back to me until my wife had to address it 48 minutes later.  The seats are as poor as the first leg. How do you expect customers to sit in these seats for such long-haul flights. No legroom and the people in front when they recline the seat your stuck with the tray on your diaphragm. I seriously dreaded the flight and the attendants as well. There was a lot of overhead Cabin baggage space where she could open and look but instead just chose to stand where she was and asked me if she could move my bag. Then when another passenger had to get his bag up, she asks my wife if the bag was hers and it was the bag of the passenger behind us. She was like it's my bag and leave it there and then the flight attendant got back to us and asked my wife to move her bag and I said no. Why don't you move the other bag instead. She didn't even have the courtesy to look for other bins if it wasn't full. But just stood in her vicinity to put the bag in and get the job done. I don't understand why do these kind of staff even work. Going to TRV via Dubai the men flight attendants were just so rude that they act like they are doing you a favor by getting you a glass of water. They asked if there's anything else like it was a big, huge task for them to get a glass of water. Juice/water/fruits ??",worst experience of my lifetime
Emirates,"Lisbon to Dubai in one of Emirates B777. The process at the airport was fairly efficient, considering that Lisbon airport can be very messy. The flight departed on time. Cabin is wide and very populated, but acceptably comfortable. The Inflight Entertainment is very good, the meals, although not as good as a few years ago, are still above the average for Economy class. The cabin crew is very nice and welcoming.",acceptably comfortable
Emirates,"Had the chance to travel in first class but this time with Emirates it was a complete different experience. The lounges, the suites, staff, food, shower on the A380, the limousine service, dedicated Lounge in Dubai, overpassed all my expectations.",complete different experience
Emirates,"I had the misfortune of booking a flight on Emirates for my daughter to fly as an unaccompanied minor. All flights were expensive so I used an app to find some cheaper flights and booked on line. I must mention that I checked with their terms and conditions to make sure I could call and change the flight to an unaccompanied minor. Firstly I never received the itinerary so I called Emirates to get this sent. Secondly I could barely understand the operator as he mumbled and had a strong accent. Once I had the itinerary I then told them I needed the unaccompanied minor added. Because I had booked flights operated by Emirates but run by Qantas, I needed to call Qantas to make the change. So I called Qantas, they had no record of the flights, then told me I need to change through the airline I booked. I called Emirates again and explained, they then said I assure you it needs to be done by Qantas. I went back and forth from airline to airline multiple times until Emirates then said there is no way I can change to unaccompanied minor and Qantas would not change it either, I finally had enough and asked to speak to someone who knew what they were doing. I spoke to a supervisor who was not rude or anything but stated I’d need to cancel the flight, take the hit and rebook via phone. I don’t think so, referring to their website that says booking electronically then adding a service is perfectly acceptable. So now I have return tickets in my daughters name that we can’t use. This is bordering on criminal if not unethical, Airlines are supposed to be helpful not members of the “Wit” family",bordering on criminal if not unethical

The rolls were stale, rock hard so they were either old stock from previous meals or your caterer is taking advantage. Its carbs and carbs and carbs. Can you not include something fresh like fruit or fruit salad. Really bad Emirates, I was shocked! My earphones were also faulty, I informed the hostess and she said she will tend to it in a while but she never did.",must be the worst food
Emirates,"I usually don't write reviews but it was a terrible, expensive travel experience and unfortunately my return is already booked with them. There was numerous issues. Food was terrible. Menu was badly selected like there was no balance nor properly matched dishes. It didn't taste good either. Snacks were bad too. In both my flights, from London to Dubai and Dubai to Phuket I had same issues with the seat. First seats are low quality shakes wiggles a lot and offers low comfort. Only good thing was leg space. In both flights infotainment system was broken. Cabin crew tried numerous resets which took 30mins each. On the 4th reset both times it worked but then suddenly while watching it stopped working again. They didn't even offer another seat and there was available options. This is crazy! Absolutely worse service and customer support ever. They have no vegetarian option. They only had Indian vegetarian option which is completely different and tailored for Indian cuisine. I would expect them to just change the main dish on the regular meal right but no! They brought vegetarian meal long before everyone else but didn't offer a drink. Cabin crew is always busy at the back and hard to get anything. They didn't offer socks, travel package. Just blanket and small pillow. I did fly with etihad, Quatar airways and Turkish airlines. Emirates was the worst. Turkish airlines offers the best food and customer service. I will never fly with Emirates. Lead cabin crew had no English and wifi is not free as they advertise.","terrible, expensive travel experience"
Emirates,"I recently flew with Emirates from Sydney to Prague, via Dubai. The flights between Sydney and Dubai were in the new Premium Economy Class, sadly not yet available between Dubai and Prague. The economy class legs of the journey were satisfactory given they were only 6 hours in duration. However the Premium Economy flights were definitely a significant improvement, and in my opinion well worth the extra expense. Bright cabin with wide comfortable seats, excellent service, improved food quality and presentation and the bathrooms in a different league from the economy class product. In every way using Premium Economy class greatly improved my travel experience and turned the long journey into something enjoyable, rather than an endurance test. My hope is that this product can be rolled out to more routes in the near future. Highly recommend for those like myself who dread the long journey from Australia to Europe.",Bright cabin with wide comfortable seats
Emirates,"My wife travelled on 6th may to Cochin to Auckland via Dubai. In checkin counter, they weighed even laptop bag also and she faced to pay around 27500INR for extra weight and spent around more than 2 hours in the checkin counter. Even if its as per the guidelines of airline this is the first experience we faced such a value less service. We travelled several air lines including low budget, they will not add the laptop in luggage weight due to their dignity. We saw number of persons facing the same. We didn't expected this type squeeze of money from Emirates",they weighed even laptop bag
Emirates,"Emirates has been the worst airline to deal with in terms of customer service. My mother travelled from Mumbai to Houston with a bag below maximum weight. In spite of that, the bag came with a wheel torn off. When we reported at the airline service desk, they took pictures and assured us that it would be processed very quickly. This was on March 25th. As of May 3rd, nothing! We called the call centers, multiple numbers, got handed around from one department to another who finally said, keep emailing as no one at the call center or baggage services number can help. Spoke to a supervisor from baggage services and all she could say was, please send the email to claims. I cannot help! Why is it called baggage services then!! My mom flies back in a few days and we are being forced to buy a new bag for her while waiting for Emirates to respond to a simple damaged bag claim! Such a hassle if anything goes wrong.",worst airline to deal with
Emirates,"Very disappointed when I approached the stewardess, (who was talking and laughing with a colleague) and asked for a red wine. She responded by saying, ‘it will be easier if you just go and ask at the kitchen at the back! Not the service you expect from Emirates.",Very disappointed
Emirates,Flight crew prevented passengers from using the restroom 1 hr prior to landing. Very uncomfortable situation when there was no warning whatsoever. The seats are old and the monitors wobble when in flight. The food was bad and the other passengers didn't finish their meals. Never flying with them again,Never flying with them again
Emirates,"The quality is super too low. We lost one piece of an airpod at an Emirates EK354 bound to Singapore at 3.30AM local time. once everyone get off the plane, we inform the cabin crew that we lost which means that we seek their assistance to help find it. One cabin crew told “oh it would be so hard to find” without helping us at all, just standing and staring. One flight manager help us instead to open the seat cover and finally we found it. Emirates is overrated for everything. Food taste was so bland, quality of the meat is very mediocre. Cabin crew issuper unfriendly. Seat is not comfortable we cant even sleep properly despite its an A380 (compared to Qantas and SQ).",Emirates is overrated for everything
Emirates,"Check-in was easy at ICN but with a disappointing lounge situation, Emirates does not own a lounge at ICN. Inflight service was generally great although business class was quite full. Connection in Dubai was also not problematic; security for connecting passengers was fast-flowing and shopping and restaurants were open. Second flight was on a B777-300 but similar levels of comfort and service was  for business class. The business class seats could be a bit narrow for some people (including myself), the in-flight service could experience delays as too many business class passengers are waiting to be served, the transit lounge at Dubai tend to be overcrowded and the in-flight Internet offering is far from satisfactory. In my case, the in-flight Internet could be purchased at $19,99 for a 10-hour flight (excluding take-off and landing the Internet would only be provided for ~8 hours at most) and streaming would still be blocked.",service could experience delays
Emirates,"A great airline with nice equipment and infrastructure, but its service (especially the ethnic flight attendants assigned to the airline's Korea service) could show some improvement. Slow service with some of the requests not honored as submitted (e.g., red wine given although white was requested), and felt like the flight attendants were not showing high levels of hospitality, on par with Emirates' reputation. Apart from this, great food and beverages selection and nice IFE system. Maybe the in-flight Internet could be revamped (price would be $19.99 for an 8-hour flight but would still block most high-bandwidth uses including streaming).",service could show some improvement
Emirates,"Mauritius to Dubai. Check-in was easy and also enjoyed priority immigration and security. Emirates uses the Air Mauritius lounge, and the lounge offered better than expected services. Inflight the flight attendants seemed to treat passengers with genuine hospitality: for the first time, felt that the bar at the back of business class cabin was a good place to relax. The food was great and good wine selections. The business class seats could be a bit narrow for some people (including myself), and the in-flight Internet offering is far from satisfactory. In-flight Internet could be purchased at $16.99 for a 6-hour flight (excluding take-off and landing the Internet would only be provided for ~4 hours at most) and streaming would still be blocked.",Check-in was easy
Emirates,"Beware booking an Emirates codeshare. I am a current silver member and have booked a flight to Tashkent (Uzbekistan) from Cairo. As Emirates doesn't service Tashkent I was booked on a Fly Dubai (code share) instead. Little did I realise that this (slight) change meant that I do not qualify for lounge access. I, after a few misrepresntations and confusing messages, was advised that I needed to be a gold member to qualify. A transit time of over five hours didn't make that experience very pleasant. This little known fact was never mentioned anywhere during my online booking process. So, beware booking a code share with Emirates, there are strings attached.",Beware booking an Emirates codeshare
Emirates,"Due to my physical condition, I fly in Business and always request wheelchair assistance. Emirates treatment and service on my Delhi/Barcelona flight (April 3rd) has been horrible. On the first flight EK 513 from Delhi to Dubai, I notified my situation and asked to the crew that, since the connection time to my flight to Barcelona was 1 hour 55 minutes, they would check that I was picked up from the plane quickly. The cabin staff told me don't worry. Upon arrival they told me that I had to wait because there was no finger but stairs. After a while and seeing how nervous I was getting, a first class attendant approached me and told me that she would take my luggage and help me down the stairs because if I didn't take the bus on the runway, I wouldn't make it to the flight to Barcelona. On the bus there was a person in an Emirates uniform who I asked if she could help me when I got to the terminal to locate a wheelchair because he had very short connection time, he refused! Upon arrival at the terminal there were no wheelchairs, I made it with difficulty to the wheelchair request point and, from there they had me getting on and off several buggies and, luckily, the driver of the last buggy helped me with the luggage to Arrive at the plane after the closing time of the flight. How is it possible that Emirates have not foreseen all this when, the user, requests this help service at the time of purchasing the ticket, therefore, sufficiently in advance? How did they not notify the terminal from the plane that I was arriving with special needs so that someone with a wheelchair or buggy? It is a shame.",treatment and service has been horrible
Emirates,"I remember that we were very satisfied with this airline until a few years ago. But now it has been 3 times that we are very dissatisfied with the quality of food and the number of times served on a long flight! Why should we feel hungry on such a long flight and when we asked for food, they only give a small packet of crackers and we have to wait for several hours until it is time to serve their disgusting food? It was not like that before, that's why we surprised!",Why should we feel hungry on such a long flight?
Emirates,"My son had vomited on a flight where my partner had left his seat to request assistance. He had gone to the adjoining cabin where he was ignored. My partner then spoke with an attendant, who started serving drinks/ meal in our cabin, who came to assess the situation and then continued to serve drinks and ignore us. From my seat, I had tried to call out to another FA, who also was serving drinks/ meals in our cabin, however did not acknowledge us. I raised my voice to attract attention to no avail. Another attendant who walked past, I had shouted for assistance, who stopped and provided help. Both the other FAs on separate occasions when approaching to serve us, had apologised and began to excuse their busy schedule but was unable to advise why they did not call for additional assistance. I spoke to a senior attendant, who apologised and advised the approach taken is not protocol and should not have happened.",shouted for assistance
Emirates,"So we paid £4K for 4 tickets to be upgraded to business class, the family wanted to try it out so I thought let’s do it. We checked in at the business class dedicated desk and were advised by the Emirates staff to proceed to gate 7 where we will find the lounge. Hand tickets over and told you don’t have access, no explanation just handed back by some power enjoying jobs worth with no options offered. I was stunned. Checked Emirates website and it clearly states our class of travel has lounge access. This is very frustrating and an underhanded approach from Emirates. Turns out this is correct, but why on earth don’t you train staff to explain this or clearly print on the ticket / emailed ticket / purchase confirmation. This must cause so many issues at the airport for people. You buy business class tickets you always get the lounge - so I thought. A very poor decision on Emirates behalf if you ask me. What a disappointment.",What a disappointment
Emirates,"Coming from Orlando on a very long flight, the plan departed 2h late and landed late, which caused missing our connection. I have travelled with 2 kids so coming from a 12h long flight and being greeted with a voucher for few meals preselected by airlines (like an apple and tomato sandwich, banana and noodle soup…things that are super unpleasant for kids to start with) super cheap offering and I have to get stuck for almost 5h on the airport with two extremely tired kids with no comfort and proper food due to airline mistake. When I asked the customer support desk to arrange for us at least a lounge or upgrade (min expected from them ), he was so rude and said this is “the best” he will offer and turned his back. So I was extremely disappointed to experience such a treatment from such an airline, they don’t take responsibility to what is their mistake and my feedback is not bothering them at all.

Emirates,"Check in at Manchester airport was fine, take off time was delayed by 40 minutes as it arrived 20 minutes late. The service has gone downhill since i last flown with them. There was no drinks services or menu cards, it was not a full flight so had the whole row of seats to myself which i utilised as a bed. The A380-800 is a great plane to fly, plenty of seat and leg room and alo very quiet. The 2nd journey was completely different, the Boeing 777-300er was old, very narrow with limited leg room, the engines were loud,t he comment ‘cattle class‘ comes to mind, there was a vietnamese couple sat next to me, the crew thought i was with them and handed me the same meal & drinks as them, luckily i wanted the same meal as them, she then realised that we were not together when i spoke and asked for a different drink. The crew seemed to lack interest. I would fly with them again but only because of their competitive price",The service has gone downhill
Emirates,I would not have bought the Emirates tickets if I knew I was flying with Qantas. Poor seats and inflight entertainment sucks (Headset point is broken). 4hrs of boredom and food is below average. Airline staff cannot figure out fix the problem or have my seats changed. Waste of money! 800NZD for round ticket AKL to MEL. Done with Emirates and Qantas (I didn't even choose Qantas). Will stick with my fav airlines Qatar and AirNZ!,Waste of money
Emirates,"Worst traveling experience in last 20 years of business and leisure traveling. They tried to force me to give my hand carry bag to luggage. To do so, they wasted my time, asked me to stand on the side and made me go and talk to lot of different people. They argue that I can not have hand carry bag and laptop bag separately. To make the situation worst another ground staff at the time of entering plane stopped me and pressurized me to board the plane with just laptop bag (which anyway going to be in my legroom).  On many occasions, I paid extra and chose Emirates for the service and comfort which seems to be a thing of a past. From now on I will never choose Emirates if I have an option.",Worst traveling experience
Emirates,On the Emirates return flight from Kolkata there was no option to pay for extra baggage during online check in even though the Emirates website mentions that passengers should be paying for extra baggage during check in to save money. The option to do so was greyed out and unavailable. I ended up paying the equivalent to $270.00 CAD for 1 extra luggage at the Emirates counter at the airport during baggage drop off. I called Emirates to complain and the customer service said it’s because it is a connecting flight from Kolkata and that option is not available. It shouldn't matter because i paid only $100 CAD during the Air Canada check in to Dubai for a stop over on the way to Kolkata. On top of that Emirates didn't update me by email or text messages after online check in. I think Emirates has really bad customer service and I will never fly with this airline again.,really bad customer service
Emirates,"Ground staff are very unfriendly and not helpful, making my trip unpleasant to start up with. The waiting line is also quite unorganized with no supporting staffs maintaining order. Nonetheless, I was able to check in my luggages and headed to the boarding gate with no big problems. Seating comfort on the economy class in B777 and food quality are above average. The entertainment screen works fine. No delays on departure. I may not want to fly Emirates in the future.",Ground staff are very unfriendly
Emirates,"In December 2022 I travelled from Sydney to Dubai with Emirates First Class. I was contacted by the Emirates car transfer company prior to collection and informed them the number of passengers and luggage, but the car that arrived was too small and the driver was rude and unhelpful. Check-in was ok, but was not given an express pass and was directed to the business lounge not first class as available for gold members. At boarding time most of the other passengers from economy were boarded before the priority boarding due to lack of staff at the gates. After boarding I asked for my meal after take off but after 1.5 hours nothing had arrived I had to call twice before someone came to me, it took nearly another 20 min before I got my meal, As my teenage children were flying in Premier economy, I checked on them but on both occasions was rudely told to return to seat my by the same cabin crew member and on the second occasion was questioned about my seat, this was totally embarrassing. After landing in Dubai I was not able to enter the first-class lounge unless I paid $420.00 for my son for 20 min, my sons airmiles were missing at the end of the trip. I complained to Emirates about the service and after 8 weeks was told the transfer company was a third party, boarding was a strict policy, that it was my fault not to help myself to some sandwiches, policy on lounge entry, and that my son was not an air miles member (he is), No apology or mention of the cabin crew behaviour, after responding to their response I basically told by them basically Emirates did not care about my business (over $250k) per year. Totally not worth the money or air miles.",totally not worth the money
Emirates,"I was quite disappointed given how much I paid for the ticket. I had a business trip in Hong Kong and I returned from Hong Kong to Bangkok. The airport was huge but the Emirates ground service was very poor. There was some issues at the check in counter causing me to wait at least half hour for my turn to check in luggage. The seats at the economy class is good, on par with other airlines. The cabin crews are nice and helpful and it seems the cabin crew are all coming from different countries but I don't any Emirati or Middle Eastern cabin crew. I wish there are more Asian food options (I'm Thai) on food instead of Middle Eastern/Arabic food. The inflight entertainment was okay, nothing surprising. With the whole flight experience, I think it is not value for money. Will take other airlines next time instead.",I was quite disappointed
Emirates,"Absolutely atrocious service of the ground staff and call center staff. I was denied boarding by their check-in staff, because I had some minor marks on my passport. The staff kept listing out the 'rules' and 'terms and conditions', and even when I asked for some solutions it was back to the rules; literally no insights When I asked about re-booking it's 'we can't help, you need to contact your travel agent'. The staff showed no compassion and provided no useful advice. I had a return flight; my outgoing flight was from London to India, then my return flight was Bahrain to London. They listed me as a 'no-show' on their 'system' - which means they also canceled my Bahrain - London flight, which I can easily make (I will get a new passport in 2 days' time) and then fly to India to continue my trip as planned (minus a few days). To get on that flight from Bahrain to London I have to pay a 200GBP 'change fee' and the difference in fare - for a flight that I have already paid for, and that I would have made.",I was denied boarding

Emirates,"After being a Skywards member for many years, this time I requested wheelchair assistance. I flew Bangkok to Cape Town and returned from Johannesburg to Bangkok. I was expecting the wheelchair transfers in Dubai to be the usual high standard. Instead of a wheelchair waiting for me as the aircraft opened its doors in Dubai, I was told to walk along the sky bridge and to find a desk that would then provide a wheelchair. I did this and found a group of men who were obviously employed to provide wheelchair assistance standing around talking to each other and did not seem to have any list of passengers who required this assistance. I was told there were not enough wheelchairs and told to walk to another area where there was no seating and I had to stand until an assistant arrived with a wheelchair. I sat in this while we went from one building to another and in the airport train. I was unceremoniously dumped at the seating area at the gate and a very long walk down a corridor and onto the skybridge awaited me. The woman sitting next to me kindly asked it I would like to lean on her arm as we traversed this onto the aircraft. I don't know what would have happened if I had been unable to walk at all. The return trip from Johannesburg to Bangkok was even worse. When we landed in Dubai there were no wheelchairs and I was asked to walk a long distance and up an escalator to an area of seating and told to wait for a golf cart. This did not appear. I was sitting next to a woman whose mobility was even worse than mine and she was in a great deal of pain. We were then told we had to walk to some other area, so the woman and I shuffled off leaning on each other vowing never to fly with Emirates again. This time we were told to wait in an area with no seats at all for a golf cart. I noticed a folded wheelchair up against a wall so I unfolded it and put my companion in it. She was most grateful. No assistance at all from the employees whose job it was to provide assistance. Eventually a golf cart came and I got in. Then there were discussions amongst the so-called assistants, and I was told to get out and wait for a different golf cart. I was the only one in this golf cart and was dumped at the correct gate where I had to walk down the sky bridge to the plane. As I get older I will increasingly need to require wheelchair assistance when I travel alone. But the appalling way I and others were treated at Dubai Airport will certainly influence me when I choose which airline to fly in the future. I go to Africa regularly. Next time I will choose Ethiopian Airlines. If you need wheelchair assistance at Dubai Airport, do not fly with Emirates.",appalling way I and others were treated
Emirates,"Had a very good experience with Emirates. Crew was very enthusiastic and attentive and the food delicious- how often do you eat everything served on a flight?

Emirates,"We traveled with a group of 5, going to Karachi via Dubai was great as we were able to pay to upgrade to business class. On the return flight we were not able to pay for the upgrade option as there was no availability.

When I asked to make sure we the wheel chair passengers are taken to the plaza lounge he asked how I had access I stated through Amex Business platinum.

Emirates,"Emirates used to be a good airline once upon a time. The airline quality, attitude of staff and service is absolutely horrible. The boarding process and the attitude of staff during boarding is very arrogant. They have no concept of service. The aircraft is clean but not as clean as it used to be. I saw stained seats.  The cabin crew are very young and inexperienced. When the aircraft had barely touched down and passengers were off their seats and the cabin crew did nothing.

I have completed a round trip from South Africa to Thailand and Malaysia on Emirates, and have nothing but praise for their stellar product. Flight from Cape Town to Dubai was on a 777, which admittedly is beginning to show signs of age, but that did not stop the staff from giving excellent service. The other three flights were all on an A380, which was comfortable and made extremely pleasant by very friendly and helpful staff. All flights were on time, and served delicious food and drink to boot. In addition, the Business Class product offers extras such as lounge access and (in my opinion the best of all) chauffeur service, which works like clockwork. Maybe its the luck of the draw, but I personally think Emirates is tops.",have nothing but praise for their stellar product
Emirates,"This complaint regarding Baggage Services. I fly from Dhaka, Bangladesh to New York and connection was in Dubai. When I landed in NY one of my luggage was missing and they told me that it was last traced in Dubai. Today, it's been 7 days and when I call customer service they are keep telling me that they couldn't find the baggage, they are looking into all the airports which sound very stupid. Everyday when I call them they are keep telling me that they are escalating to higher authority. Also they are ensuring me that I will receive a call back in 24 hours which never happened in last 7 days. I am very annoyed right now don't know what should I do.",one of my luggage was missing
Emirates,"My partner and I requested wheelchair and assistance. He has his own electric wheelchair.

I am afraid of losing the flight and am still being ignored after about an hour and 15 min.  This company doesn’t have the most basic respect for the passengers! Economy class passengers are human beings too. I try to avoid wheelchairs but airports and the long walking distances with all the luggage are a challenge. They do not even start to check in economy before all business passengers are gone. They don’t even pretend to care! I don’t know if I am going to a developed country anymore. The introduction is not good. When I finally got assistance, the lady helping me was extremely nice (Mariluz). Value for money - a waste of money Ground service below horrifying.",Ground service below horrifying
Emirates,"My recent experience with them has been quite disappointing. The cabin crew are less friendly than I remember them to be years back, especially the male crew. I experienced this on all four legs of my recent journey. They felt like more of bouncers (i.e the men), as they didn't smile, weren't friendly or approachable, and instead of telling me this way, please, as I have always been used to during boarding, one of the men simply got in my way and gestured me to go in the other direction, without uttering a word. I found this to be a bit rude. To add to this, some crew members on various legs of my trip didn't offer me a beverage during snacktime, while they offered my neighbours some. And it's not because I had my headphones on or was asleep or seemed uninterested. They glanced at me and somehow decided I wouldn't be interested in a cuppa? This happened three different times! I will continue to fly with them as they offer some of the best prices. However, i do hope to see friendlier faces in future.",has been quite disappointing
Emirates,"My Husband and I travelled on Emirates on November 24th 2022 from Seattle to Dubai, seated in row 19, and sadly it was the experience I was expecting.  This was a 14+ hour flight, and one would think the crew would be friendly and check on the passengers more, however the only time we saw them was during boarding, food service and disembarking and without smiles. After and before the food service the crew were nowhere to be seen. On other flights with other airlines the air hostesses will come by a couple of time with water/ tea/coffee or just even walk by to make sure if anything was needed. I understand people may want to sleep but you can also do it without waking up the passengers. Thirdly, the food was not appetizing, and not only that but if Emirates is releasing the menu on the app with a couple options (veg and non-veg) on the plane I was told I cant have the veg because I didn’t order it, Then why was it an option and it didn’t have anything on the side that said Pre-order. Ended up taking the meal with he chicken which was dry and hard like a baseball. I didn’t eat it. We were served a pizza snack and it wasn’t warmed up well. I am not one who leaves reviews but I understand that Emirates is a well renowned brand and company and my review will not matter to them but at the end of the day it was my hard earned money that I used to pay for my Flight. They say Emirates is a number 1 airline in the world and flying them is almost a privilege, but I disagree, Sorry.",the crew were nowhere to be seen
Emirates,"Though Emirates only operates a handful of flights to and from Milan, it maintains a nice, spacious lounge with ample seating and good selections of food. I could walk around and pick any seat I want in the lounge without having to sit next to strangers. Tables in the dining area were quickly cleared and cleaned after guests left, so they were always ready for the next guests. One unique thing about Emirates was that I could board directly from the lounge, which made things much easier. On board, the A380 was nice. Every seat had a minibar, which was nice. Emirates does not offer full turndown service the way Qatar Airways does, but a mattress pad was provided (like on Japan Airlines) to make a more comfortable bed. The gender specific amenity kit, by Bvlagri, was very nice and useful. Food was good in general, and wine selection was ahead of other airlines, but service was slow and a bit inconsistent. However, I did encounter one of the nicest attendants in the sky.",Food was good in general
Emirates,"First time flying business class with Emirates and it was very disappointing. A very early pre-boarding process in Amsterdam, while the crew was waiting in the tiny area as well for the airplane to be cleaned. So 500 People squeezed into a waiting area for an hour. Boarding is messy. Boarding music is terrible and, if delayed, played on repeat for hours. The seat is quite nice. The crew works very hard, but the service is just chaotic and messy with their trays, stuff stacked on top of each other. Meal service starts 2 hours after take off. On the way back used the business lounge in Dubai. It is far from the quality of lounges other airlines have, including most European airlines. Again delayed. Gipsy King music again for the 2 hours on ground during boarding. Poorly informed by the captain and mixed/contradicting info from the cabin crew. All the purser could say that “it wasn't their fault”. Overall, all facilities and procedures are quite average, food and drinks are ok. (Drinks actually very nice), crew was a mix of friendly, hard-working people and some who couldn’t care less.",it was very disappointing
Emirates,"This was not a very good experience. Starting with the Airport, I was forced to check one of my carry-ons due to “no space” on the plane although it was not a full flight and I was made to pay a huge amount of money just for that and what’s worse is that the bag had a lot fragile souvenirs and I risked breaking all of them. Thank goodness it was loaded in Japan and no harm was done and the bag dodged a bullet. I don’t remember Emirates being that needlessly strict. I’m not sure if the airline changed the aircraft because the extra legroom seat that I paid for was different than the one I got as the exit door was in the way so I had to lean a little on the person next to me to get the full legroom feel. It was a long flight but it went smooth and the food was extremely delicious. The flight attendant that was assigned to our row, although efficient, made me feel like an inconvenience as she had very low energy and didn’t seem very enthusiastic to the point that while was pouring me apple juice, the carton ran out of juice while the cup was half full and that’s how she served it without bothering to open another carton. For the whole flight I was waiting for her to pass by us so I can ask the other, much nicer attendant for water and/or assistance whenever I needed something. For some weird reason, the much advertised On Air WiFi did not work which took another point out.",not a very good experience
Emirates,"I have been flying Emirates for 15 years and was a gold member for much of that time. From 2007 - 2012 their customer service was almost unmatched but things have been getting worse over the past 10 years or so and now I would say it is the worst of any airline in the world. I have flown Emirates 3 times this year out of necessity and each time it has been a complete disaster. Emirates has now switched from operating like a typical full service carrier to something more akin to a low-cost airline. Not only do they have 4 fare classes (economy, premium, business & first) but each of those classes is split into 4 types (special, saver, flex & flex-plus). The saver fares usually look too good to be true because they are! If you find a low price on a special or saver fare when booking in advance you may think you got a good deal but try to make any changes to the flight and you will soon find that the airline tries to gauge you for extortionate 'fare differences'. Even if you try to change your flight to one that costs exactly the same as the flight you are on and there are empty seats in your fare class, they will tell you that your 'fare type' is no longer available and extort you for hundreds if not thousands of dollars to make the change. Even if the flight you're on is full and the flight you want to switch to is half empty (something you think the airline would be glad of) they still try to gauge you. If you're lucky enough to get through to customer service, they will not offer you any assistance whatsoever - their job is just to extract as much extra cash from you as they can. I have come to expect this and so avoid Emirates where I can. My latest experience with Emirates customer service was far worse than my already very low expectations. I tried to use the Emirates app to make a change to the flight time. I had a Saver fair so there was a change fee of £100. This was clearly stated in the terms and conditions of the ticket so I was happy to pay. However, when I got to the screen to put in my credit card details, the app crashed. I tried again and the same thing happened. Rather than keep trying to work with a defective app, I called the airline to make the change over the phone. A recorded message said that the airline was extremely busy and that if I was not flying in the next 48 hours, I should hang up and call back later. I complied with this request and hung up the call. As soon as I got back to my hotel room, I got on the laptop to make the change. despite only being a couple of hours later, there was suddenly a 'fare difference' to pay. Since it was the Emirates app that had failed when I tried to make the change and since their call center was too busy to take my call at that time, I was sure that Emirates would do the right thing and match the price from when I had first attempted the change. I thought wrong! I spoke to a hopeless fist line call center worker who could not help so I asked to speak to a supervisor. The supervisor said that he did not have any authority to make changes to flights, despite the fact that he told me that he was the most senior person in the airline I could speak to. Eventually, I was put through to another man a second level supervisor (or officer)",worse than my already very low expectations

I asked her if any complications for wheelchair just arrange to drop me in boarding Gate. She told me not possible at all. If I will move my seat from upper deck to main deck then only possible. I asked her why. She told me we Emirates don’t provide wheelchair service in upper deck. I asked her what will happen, the passengers who needs wheelchair assistance & traveling in business class obviously seats in upper deck. She didn’t respond. We can not provide wheelchair assistance in upper deck. I told her no need upper deck as I need until the boarding Room. She refused me. Very worst service ever in my life. Avoid Emirates, who need special Assistance I mean wheelchair.",Very worst service ever
Emirates,I always travel by Emirates and liked it but this was my first time traveling with my 14 months old baby. The seat I got was too small to fit us both. I didn’t know I have to carry my baby even when he’s asleep. I asked for bassinet and they said if baby’s legs are not straight while lying in bassinet then it’s not for the baby. I had to carry him throughout the flight because he was mostly asleep. When they provided me meal I couldn’t open my table as while holding baby table couldn’t be opened. I barely ate a little and gave up. Meal for baby was also not provided although it was included in the ticket. It was a huge disappointment. I couldn’t use inflight entertainment either for baby because there was no room.,It was a huge disappointment
Emirates,I got a last minute upgrade offer and went for it without contemplation. The business class seats on the Boeing 777 were comfortable and I managed to get a very good sleep. The service was excellent and I felt really spoiled and taken care of. The meals were also good starting with the beef and rice dinner and ending with a delicious omelette breakfast. I remember the Emirates infotainment “ICE” had more variety before but I was still kept well occupied.,The service was excellent
Emirates,The flight departed a little late. Boarding was organised. Had Aisle seat 84C which chose and paid for At booking. Gluten Free meal served early and cabin crew checked name and request for Gluten free. Best Gluten Free meals on any airline. The cabin crew on this flight worked nonstop. Water and soft drinks between meals which was good. One cabin crew stood out on this flight she was constantly attending passengers needs and had a bright energetic personality. My husband and i arrived slightly late into Brisbane but safely. First flight of 14 hours which i never felt jet lagged and flown this flight many times put it down to only drinking water with meals whole flight.,Best Gluten Free meals
Emirates,"Venice to Dubai 12 November. Check in very good at Marco Polo Airport. Some one in Emirates uniform directing passengers. At check in the staff not wearing Emirates uniform but excellent customer service and said she would check if once we arrived in Australia she could give us boarding pass for our Qantas connection in Brisbane for final destination but was not able. Later at boarding gate called over and received Boarding pass for final onward journey. The flight to Dubai was good, Allocated twin seats which booked and paid for and Excellent Gluten free meal served early. Cabin crew came around with water and soft drinks between meals and we arrived safely in Dubai for onward connection to Brisbane.",flight to Dubai was good
Emirates,"Absolutely awful service both inbound and outbound traveling with an infant. Emirates made a mistake on my booking with an infant which resulted in me having to spend 2 hours at in the airport running between check in desk and ticketing desk with a hungry crying infant to rectify the mistake Emirates created. Onboard the return flight, the flight attendant refused to provide bottled water for so I could prepare infant formula despite having charged me 10% ticket price as infant fare. Finally, on arrival we found our stroller damaged and the baggage team is proposing to offer is 500 AED which is insufficient to replace the stroller. Absolutely awful experience. I urge travelers with infants to choose a better airline.",Absolutely awful experience
Emirates,"Overall business class is quite good with friendly and polite flight staff. Few cons: seats are quite narrow. I'm 5'4, 125 pounds and my elbows were hitting either side. You can lay on your back quite comfortably but I don't know how a bigger person will be comfortable especially on long haul flights. In each of the 4 legs at every meal time, the flight attendant asked me  do you want to eat dinner/ lunch/ brunch?. Of course I would. Where would I go for sustenance on a 15 hour flight? It's not like I could jump out the plane for takeout or fix myself a sandwich. Felt like a weird question like I was waiting for a free meal in a soup kitchen.  Meal service was super slow. On one of the legs, the flight attendant set my table for brunch and the actual brunch arrived 45 minutes later, during lunch time. And my vegan brunch was just a Chia seed pudding which was probably dumped into a bowl from a Mason jar so not sure why the delay. The vegan options were quite pathetic and almost unpalatable on 2 of the 4 legs. Just a mush of steamed rice/ noodles and veggies isn't really a vegan meal. For a $5k ticket, I'd have hoped Emirates would've been a little creative and thoughtful with the vegan meal.",Meal service was super slow
Emirates,"Emirates, together with its agents, is engaged in deception and fraud in the exchange of tickets. I couldn't change my flight tickets for 2.5 weeks! They changed me a few hours before departure and took a fine of 200 euros. If you want to ruin your trip and vacation, contact Emirates, they will do it professionally!",took a fine of 200 euros
Emirates,"Superb airline. I really can not fault the airline at all. The cabin crew are extremely attentive, polite and friendly. The food was very tasty. In flight entertainment was very extensive for two 6 hours flights.",Superb airline
Emirates,"Bangkok to Frankfurt via Dubai. The service on board was great. The touchscreen of the board entertainment system is on some planes are better than on others. The movie collection was vast but didn't fit my taste. My seat wasn't locked. So, it changed position without pushing the button. However, those minors didn't bother me because of the good value and the great staff. What bothered me is the lack of goodwill of the Emirates on ground service. Emirates offered to reschedule the booked flights because of the Covid-19 pandemic for three years (what was great). However, our daughter became 13 years old during that time and a new more expensive adult ticket was needed for her. However, we saved about 150 Euro for her previous ticket, we had to add another 600 Euro for the new ticket. To get the new ticket kept us almost two hours on the phone with fast speaking call service assistants. On the way back, we had to pay additional 217 Euro for overweight. That was new for us, because we always could have one to two more kilogram per suitcase. Maybe it is standard nowadays, but every weight scale is different, therefore I think airlines good except two kilos more per suitcase. Families seem to be disadvantaged in this concern. They count the overweight as total. If family members check in individually, they could save a few bucks.",good value and great staff
Emirates,EK135 22 October Seat 46A. This flight was a continuation of the Brisbane to Dubai flight 24 hours later. The flight was not full but paid and was given twin seats for myself and wife. Worth the extra cost as 3 rows of seats behind reserved for cabin crew who never used them on this flight. Took off on time arrived on time 2 meals served on flight and usual water and soft drinks tea and coffee. A good flight.,A good flight
Emirates,Brisbane to Dubai. Paid for seat selection and was given correct seat aisle 84c was fortunate there was empty middle seat on 14 hour flight. The Gluten Free meals which Emirates serve are excellent. The flight went smoothly and landed safely. Perhaps the only negative was water given with 2 meals and snack no cabin crew coming around with extra water between you seem to have to ask. Then stayed overnight at Dubai Airport Hotel before onward journey to Venice.,Gluten Free meals are excellent
Emirates,"The service I expected from a low cost carrier, not one of the supposedly best airlines in the world. One of the check in ladies at Copenhagen refused to let me carry on my carry on baggage, despite having taken 12 other flights, including 2 other Emirates flights with no problems on this trip. I went and repacked a few things and lined back up and the same lady went and told every other agent about me. I have never been treated so poorly by airline staff. I ended up in tears and they couldn't care less.  It isn't much better on board. The cabin crew are not overly friendly, you press the call button and it takes so long to get help you wonder if it worked. The food is also average, one of the meals was so horrible, I couldn't even eat it and they feed you at odd times. The entertainment options are terrible, most of the options I hadn't heard of to the point where I downloaded movies on Netflix to watch instead. All in all, for an airline that I was so excited to fly with, it hasn't been a great experience and I will be looking at other airlines before flying Emirates again that's for sure.",hasn't been a great experience
Emirates,"A very cramped journey from Bali to Dubai in economy with barely any space to put my feet and I am only 5 ft 2. The pilot was very communicative about passing tropical weather and the air hostess were lovely. With just a 1 hour transit in Dubai I hopped onto the A380 which is much bigger but the walkways are still soo mall. The air hostess on this flight were not as friendly. A particular air hostess kept telling me off because I crossed my legs and my foot slightly went onto the aisle, I mean we were so squished. I fell asleep and they didn’t serve me the first meal, or even offer a drink when I woke up, they just past me as if I didn’t exist. The second meal was an excellent portion size, the food could barely fit on the tray. I particularly liked the greek yoghurt and granola, and cheese and biscuits - for the hot food it wasn’t impressive. I had better food on cheaper airlines. The air hostess were OK about re filling my water bottle. All in all I think I would try another airline for this long journey next time, just a few bad vibes from the staff with regards to meals and sleeping as mentioned above.",think I would try another airline
Emirates,"Dubai to New York. I misspelled a letter while booking my ticket, found out in the email I received, called to correct a letter, they charged me $30. Bad practice / regulation Emirates Airline. Will avoid in further booking.",Will avoid in further booking
Emirates,"Bangkok to Johannesburg via Dubai. This must have been the worst booking experience and customer service of my life. My partner and I booked the exact same route at the exact same time from 2 different laptops directly from the Emirates website. Emirates confirmed they received his payment, the money was out of his account, but part of his flight is not yet confirmed. After a couple of attempts, they made some adjustments and sorted out the issue a few hours later. My booking could not process payment due to a pricing problem between the airlines. After numerous failed attempts over 3 days via customer service and live chats, failed rebooking attempts for the same route, and empty promises from customer agents calling me back, I finally just booked another date to ensure that we can at least spend Christmas together. NEVER in my life have I experienced any issues like this with Qatar (or any other airlines for that matter). Emirates advertise routes and when it comes to booking, they're not able to process and if they do process, they do a half-ass job which leaves customers feeling stressed and running around trying to finalize flight details. Avoid avoid avoid is all I can say. There is a reason Qatar airways is 5 star, and Emirates is 4 star.",worst booking experience
Emirates,Very impolite and rude cabin crew from ticketing counter to inside the plane. No just they don’t want help but also ignore you. And you try to catch the attention they literally yell and pass sarcastic comments. I was traveling with my 1 year old. They made our flight a horrible experience and on purpose they did not offer baby food in a 7 hour flight. All crew looked unhappy and were unpleasant to talk with mostly female crews. My flight from Dubai to Algeria was a nightmare because of crew negative behavior and lack of empathy for a mother who’s was traveling with a 1 year old.,Very impolite and rude cabin crew
Emirates,It wasn’t a good experience at all. Young newly married couple who were clearly already pretty tipsy on boarding starting boozing hard as soon as it took off and kept a steady pace of drinking solidly for the entire 8hr flight. Cabin attendants kept giving them can after can even though they were getting very drunk. No consideration for others seated anywhere near them and it was really quite uncomfortable given the volume of their constant loud drunken chatter. After we landed at Dubai as I was standing in the aisle waiting on someone lifting something down from the overhead bins the male passenger staggered to his feet wobbled towards me and aggressively barked “where do you think you’re going eh?” Thankfully he was drunk enough I could sidestep him and leave him swaying around but come on Emirates you’re better than this. The cabin attendants should have stopped serving this pair long before landing as they were clearly intoxicated. Not good at all.,attendants should have stopped serving this pair
Emirates,"Firstly, canceled flights departing Athens to Perth leaving us stranded in Athens for a night so we had to get accomodation. Then you had my booked with a 14 hour stop over in Dubai which is unacceptable. I requested this to be changed and it was to a later flight which worked better. I was reassured my partners flight had been linked (we had separate bookings) and that we were both on the new flight together (this was via virtual chat). We arrive at the airport to check in and even though he had received flight confirmation we were told he didn’t have tickets so we had to go get this sorted at the emirates desk. We’re both finally on the same flight only to be told we cannot be seated together on either of the flights even though we booked months ago and had already selected our seats together. The man at Athens airport checking us in did not care or try to assist us. Absolutely terrible experience and now my partner and I get to sit alone on an 11 hour flight. Completely unacceptable and very poor form from Emirates. I want a refund or some form of compensation for the hotel, meals in Athens whilst stranded and the stress of this whole situation. Completely ruined the end of our trip. I will never fly with them again.",Absolutely terrible experience
Emirates,"Outbound (BAH TO DXB): Smooth flight, generous amount of food for such a short flight and it was tasty as well Outbound (DXB to BHX): Disastrous, flight was overbooked and cramped making the staff take a long time to board, we economy passengers were basically treated like cattle. IFE wasn't responsive, and food especially breakfast were bad - portions fit for a child, and mid flight I realized the meals had given me stomach pains and nausea. Inbound (BHX to DXB): Extremely bad service, 3 hours after take off and nothing (not even drinks) were given, my blood sugar started going down and I got dizzy because of that. When meals were served finally, it seemed the attendants forgot to give a lot of people meals (including my seat mate). Besides that, my meal was terrible barely cooked pasta with a droplet of sauce, dead vegetables that was pathetically called a salad, and I was given a bread roll with nothing to use it with. Crew barely served any drinks, I got massively dehydrated (7hrs flight), and in the morning they refused to serve me breakfast because I woke up 2 hours before landing - not even a coffee or tea was offered to me. Overall, it's was a very below average flight and Emirates is overhyped for nothing.",Emirates is overhyped for nothing
Emirates,"The flight in which i travelled from Dubai to Amsterdam turned out to be the worst experience by Emirates. Water was dripping from the roof and the crew took it very lightly. They were responding that we have informed to our manager, but no actions were taken about it till i landed in Amsterdam. I literally had to hold and sit with the plastic cover they had given as the blanket cover for most of the distance.",the worst experience by Emirates
Emirates,My first experience of Emirates new premium economy class. Food and service excellent. Seats however are a little bit firm and not as comfortable as the pictures suggest. Also the recline is quite big so you can feel a little trapped once the person in front refines. Access to three toilets for 50 plus passengers is a real bonus and you get glimpses of the flight deck if that is an interest. I paid very little in cost difference which was the attraction but Emirates economy is very good in any case so May not always be a choice I am willing to pay much extra for. Also it was a two meal service for a seven hour flight which is good.,Food and service excellent
Emirates,"When I fly from Jakarta to Zurich transit Dubai on 19 august the cabin crew was unpolite, Isit in the middle between my husband and my daughter, they ask my husband and my daughter for dinner but did not ask me so I call the bell for dinner and told that I am running out of food choices. Very disappointing.",Very disappointing
Emirates,"Wish I had read these reviews. I paid over £2,500 for tickets from London to Dubai to Bangladesh for early next year. I’m travelling with my wife and 2 babies (1 &2.5 years old). The only reason I chose their flights was because it gave the best option of 14 hours in total for flight and transit which is still long with 2 babies but better than 21.5 hours, they suddenly decided to change my original flights, booked only 10 days before, they’ve sent me a text and a short email to say: this is your new itinerary nothing else. I was shocked. How could any airline be so insensitive knowing that these customers are flying with an infant and a 2.5 year old so the least they could do instead of sending us a little text and email giving us no option whatsoever to change or contact them to discuss or be decent to call us at least to see if this was acceptable or not, did we want to change our flights or else cancel and get a refund as they have breached our contract. But nothing and when we tried to call their number in London this guy said he can’t help us with rebooking or a refund but he can put us through to them in Dubai. I hang on and on for 3 hours before realising this was a trick to just get rid of us. I got tired and hung up. There is no other way for us to contact them now at all because when we call their only one number in London you get the due to high volume of calls we can’t answer your call, when I tried the only number given in Dubai nobody answers. Not only are we devastated but also out of pocket by £2,500 because we can’t possibly go on their imposed alternative flight of 21.5 hours with 2 small restless babies.",Wish I had read these reviews
Emirates,"We chose to book a more expensive flight due to shorter transit time in Dubai. However, just a few weeks before our flight, Emirates, without giving us any options, just changed our flight date and a much longer transit time in Dubai, no offer for a hotel overnight stay. In ZH, they have no office, nor could we contact their phone no. It is a frustrating and a sad first time try with Emirates.",a frustrating and a sad first time try with Emirates
Emirates,Dubai to Brisbane. Very disappointed with overall care factor. Booked seat a week ahead of flight and was changed by airline with the comments due to operational requirements with no effort to fix it. Never again with these guys they simply don’t care.,Very disappointed with overall care
Emirates,"Avoid this airline at all costs! They forced me to check my carry-on, and then they lost it. Since then, they have not made any attempt to locate it beyond emailing the airport, even though I have called them daily, written to them on Facebook, and submitted multiple complaint forms (they have no answered the complaint forms). I every time I call them, they say Ma'am, we've emailed the airport and haven't heard back yet. Please be patient. I've called the airport, and the representative I spoke with said that Emirates needs to show up in person to locate my missing suitcase - he said that just emailing the airport, as they've done, will accomplish nothing. When I relayed this info to Emirates, they refused to listen. Everyone I've spoken with tries to get off the phone as quickly as possible without taking steps to investigate the issue. It's incredibly frustrating to be stuck in this limbo with airline that will not solve a problem that is their responsibility to solve.",Avoid this airline at all costs
Emirates,A very pleasant trip on Emirates Economy from Dallas to Dubai. EK remains the best in Economy. I couldn't fault this flight at all. Check in was easy and friendly ground handling agents despite Dallas being chaotic due to the storms. Onboard the cabin crew were friendly and attentive. The food was plentiful and the IFE was excellent. Wifi was slowish at times but suffice for WhatsApp and communication. I was dreading flying 15 hours in coach but EK made this experience a lot better!,A very pleasant trip
Emirates,"Very disappointed and unprofessional. We flew from Lebanon to Dubai and then to Sydney our baggage was delayed so it was meant to arrive on the next flight. A week later with no information at all about our baggage which we had to chase up on a daily basis, the bags arrived damaged. We emailed them and attached photos of the baggage and did not receive a reply. They need to reimburse us for the damaged baggage. Will not be flying with them again.",Very disappointed and unprofessional
Emirates,"I travelled with many airlines until à now and it was the worse service I got. The first time I didn’t get my luggage on arrival and no compensation above all. An airlines who allows itself to plan short connection, and arrives late in Dubai, to the price of leaving your luggages behind. And after complaining to the customer service, this is what you get : “ Dear Miss Bacconnet, Thank you for your correspondence. I regret the inconvenience you experienced when your baggage was not available for collection upon you arrival in Paris on 30 May 2022. Our records indicate that your baggage was unintentionally left behind in Dubai and subsequently returned to you. Compensation for delayed baggage is offered to passengers to assist with the purchase of essential items of an immediate need. Passengers who are residents in the country where the claim has been registered are not eligible for this payment. Delayed baggage compensation also does not cover consequential expenses such as hotel accommodation, transportation, loss of income etc. We are not in a position to offer compensation and recommend that you contact your insurance company for assistance. Thank you for the opportunity to respond. We hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you on board in the near future under more favourable circumstances. Yours sincerely, Emirates Customer Affairs” Apparently, even though I don’t leave in Paris, I don’t have “essential needs” because my country can its residents all their essential needs. It is well known that when you live in a country, everything is free for you. Like I didn’t pay the hotel because I had to wait for my luggage for almost two hours after someone came to me to let me know it’s not gonna come today so that I missed my train back home. Consequently I had to book a night in a hostel because a hotel in Paris is crazy expansive. And as I didn’t have essentials I had to pay not less than 4€ to rent a ridiculous cheap quality towel. The service onboard is not exceptional, the crew is not really willing to help. The AC is crazy low and when you ask for second blanket, it looks like you ask too much. Compared to Qatar there is no free wifi allowance.",was the worse service I got
Emirates,"On 14th August flight EK818 was delayed due to bad weather etc. However what followed was disappointing and highly unprofessional by Emirates Dubai Staff. Was put on EK2010 to JFK although I requested for next day EK213. Emirates lied by misinforming that none was available. Came to know later that those who shouted were accommodated.

Emirates,"Emirates not to blame, but Munich Airport (Terminal 1) was a shame: dirty, unorganised, very few options for food etc. In short not what to expect in Germany. Check in a bit tacky (but friendly) regarding visa and check-in system not running, but after 20 mins I finally got my boarding pass. On both flights I got an excellent meal with appetiser, main, cheese and desert on a tray and it was no problem to get some wine with it. A generous perk as Silver EK-member is I was permitted into the Emirates Business Lounge in Dubai, which is an excellent place for a shower, some really good food.",I got an excellent meal
Emirates,"I use different airlines very frequently, and Emirate is one the worst. It canceled my original flight and change to new one with more than 8 hours gap, and they didn't suggest any facility. Also, the reason for canceling the first flight is unclear, because the first flight was working and no need to change my flight. Their behavior in check-in was very rude. They weight everything even a tiny kid backpack and charged very expensively for even 1 kilo overweight. Finally, I never use this unreliable airline.",behavior in check-in was very rude
Emirates,We traveled from Cochin to Dubai on 31st July via Business class. I had a horrendous experience with the flight attendants. The supervisor and the assistant had completely forgotten all the etiquette and the hospitality they are supposed to extend. I feel Emirates must give refresher courses to the staff and continuous evaluation should be taken to maintain the standard. When I expressed my displeasure they were asking me what should I serve to make me happy and I told them we don't choose Emirates for food. I'm thoroughly disappointed with their attitude and behavior.,!I had a horrendous experience
Emirates,I am a Gold member of Skywards. During a flight departing from Toronto to Dubai the flight crew allowed the children sitting behind me to use my seat as a climbing frame. With no regard for myself or the other passengers within the row nothing was addressed. Eating the served meal was impossible as was any attempt at drinking any fluids. This was drawn to the attention of both the parents and the flight staff all to no avail. If the children were not climbing then they were kicking the back of my seat. The children would seldom sit even during turbulence and during take-off and landing. After so many years of traveling with Emirates this whole encounter will cause me to look at alternate airlines.,cause me to look at alternate airlines
Emirates,"My brother in Kenya died suddenly in a construction accident so I had to get a flight home quickly as funerals happen quickly in Kenya. We found a suitable flight with Emirates although it was about triple what I normally pay for a planned flight home. At Birmingham the checkin staff were not very helpful and then the flight to Amsterdam was delayed but I was told not to worry, I would still get my onwards flight from Schipol to Nairobi. However, when I arrived at Amsterdam my flight had departed. I was offered a flight 24 hours later but turned it down as I would miss my brother’s funeral and I would be devastated. I was offered and accepted an alternative flight via Entebbe, Uganda, which I accepted. However, when I arrived at Entebbe I was refused boarding on the flight to Nairobi - Emirates had messed up. I had no money for an alternative flight and no roaming on my phone so I Whattsapp’d my husband in UK and he phoned up Emirates Dubai office at great expense and after half an hour convinced the call handler to book me onto a later flight to Nairobi. I missed my brother’s funeral and I will never forgive Emirates for their incompetence and lack of care.

Emirates,"Service is below sub standard. I travelled with my 2 daughters of 2 and 7 years. I bought my seat at the time of booking and the system wouldn’t let me to do the same for my daughters. At the time of online check in, I found out that my daughters were seated 7 rows ahead of me on their own which shocked me. Furthermore, I raised my concerns to the officer at the check-in desk. Her seat allocation was more terrible than the system. She allocated me in the middle seat, 2 year at the aisle and 7 year aisle right across making her to sit with a stranger. I was frightened to hear that bad news and had to escalate the issue to the supervisor. Finally, after 20-25 minutes of waiting, supervisor made me (compulsion) to sit with my daughters 7 seats ahead of my paid chosen seat. At least, it was a big relief for me before boarding. Money paid for my chosen seat was gone into Emirates account and no refund was made until now. More paper work following to claim it and a waste of time, so let Emirates enjoy that undeserved money. Service offered by the airline was below standard when compared to the rest of Middle Eastern Carriers and other standard carriers. Families travelling with kids were of least to no concern by the crew. However, I have to admit that Emirates managed to arrive the destination on time. On the return leg, my luggage is not delivered yet or lost on the way. Another issue to deal with Emirates now. Service had gone from standard to pathetic. I need to think million one times to make another booking with Emirates. Families travelling with kids are not recommended to choose this airline.

Emirates,"Checked in at Bergen for flight Oslo with SAS connecting to Dubai with Emirates. Arrived early. Waited at gate in Oslo before flight started to board and was 2nd in line. Bags were checked all the way through to Dubai, where we would then have a rest and get a flight to Melbourne the following day. Attempted to board and told our tickets had been cancelled - by us! Somehow in the air from Bergen, we decided to cancel our own tickets and delay seeing our 4 children and give up a weekend in Dubai - seems unlikely. Argued the point but no interest in listening to us and the flight left without us. We were not told where to go, who to contact, how to get any help and we had to wait for hours for our luggage to be returned to us after it was taken off the plane. We spent two days stranded in Oslo airport with no help from Emirates at all. Our travel agent confirmed that it was in fact Emirates that cancelled our tickets - for being a “no show” which is 100% wrong and we can prove this. We spent money on hotel, footed and lost money in Dubai from prebooked accommodation. Emirates would not give us anything in compensation. Flight home was empty / half full. No offer of upgrade or anything at all from customer service (or lack of customer service!). After a terrible flight home, straight through to Melbourne we were now a day late due to the airline. We lost a days work and had to re-schedule deliveries at additional cost to our business. After several attempts to write, email and call emirates customer service on return to Melbourne, we have had zero response! The lack of service and care for customers is disgraceful. I was prepandemic a frequent international flyer and in 20 years I have never seen such a poor display. I will never fly this airline again. Emirates is an appalling company that cares nothing for the customer experience. They do not care for Australian passengers - it’s all about looking after their own profits. Fly at your own risk as they will cost you money and care less. Oh - actually they did offer us a special treat from business class, how could I forget they asked if we wanted a cappuccino from a machine. I don’t drink coffee.",lack of service and care for customers is disgraceful
Emirates,"This is the most unpleasant business class travel experience I have ever had. My check-in luggage is missing, despite I confirmed with the check-in counter in Dubrovnik multiple times that my luggage will be delivered automatically to Japan without any manual transfer procedure required in Dubai. The WIFI (cost 19.9 usd) I bought onboard doesn't work most of the time. When I went to the toilet shortly before landing, the attendant reluctantly open the door for me. But he kept pushing by saying do it really quick and even knocked the door irritatedly. He didn't apologise even after I asked him to use proper English and better manner. The company changed the aircraft without notice. I book the aisle seat but it ended up as a window seat. (Another attendant helped me change the seat. That is the only positive experience onboard.)",the most unpleasant business class

The food was good and the entertainment was endless with something for everyone (Japanese music for me). The staff were friendly and the seats were comfortable.,boarding was super organized
Emirates,"The baggage rules are non consistent with what is displayed on Expedia and once you are at the airport they charge high overweight fees. Even if upgrading my ticket to Flex would have solved the weight limit for a cheaper price the staff refused to make any change. Also, despite the emergency seat being partially free I was not allowed to take one because I haven't paid extra fees upfront for this option. I heard good things about this company, yet as my first experience turned out to be a nightmare I’ll stay far away from this one in the future. I hope ANA will soon resume operating their own flight to France soon.",turned out to be a nightmare

I am 6’5 feet tall and have bad knees. After boarding, there were at least 3 empty seats at the emergency exit in economy class, I asked the crew if I could change my seat to one the emergency exit empty seat. The reply was you need to pay $200 extra for that. I explained why I need to move to a seat with more leg space and that it’s still an economy seat that no one is using, they simply said sorry we can’t. The whole flight I was shivering and when I asked for an extra blanket the reply was sorry everyone is asking for extra blanket. I has a much better experience with other airlines. Emirates is so overrated unless you are booking on business or first class.",Emirates is so overrated
Emirates,"In the last 4-years, Emirates customer service has become one of the worst. I doubt they are any better than a 2-star service. Their airport staffs are either rude or cold. Their in-flight food service is mediocre. Although, the food is above average. They offer minimal service when it comes to offering water or drinks during the flight. I tried upgrading using family account points, a feature with Emirates. It is more or less a scam scheme designed to pool all your points in your family account. The idea is you can upgrade your journey or family members' journey using the family account. However, you cannot access these points when you want to upgrade. So you are left with no points in your account and storing all your points in your family account, and you can't use them. Emirates airport staffs and cabin crews are so poorly trained. Both Airline check-in staff, Cabin Crew and support staff have no clue how the family account works. I heard 4-different versions of the policies. They send me round in circles on 2 different trips, and the issue still remains unresolved after a week. As a gold member, I get a pleasant smile and a warm welcome, but that is just faking a few words that have no value whatsoever. Anytime I requested any help, I more or less got nothing for being Gold. The only thing that remains for being Gold is Fast Check-in in the Dubai airport and a few other airports outside the UAE, Lounge access, and sometimes faster delivery of your check-in baggage. There was a time Emirates was better or as good as Qatar Airways. Overall, EK's poor customer service let it down big time. As a customer, my last 2 experiences have been terrible.",customer service has become one of the worst
Emirates,"We were flying from Mumbai to JFK via Dubai on 7th June, 2022. When we were checking in, looks like only 1 cabin baggage is allowed (and no personal item) while you are flying out from India. This was not the case when I was flying in from the USA. Looks like this is the rule only from India. We were charged a very high price of 35,000 Rupees for just 2 personal items which was a backpack and handbag. We had no choice but to pay. This was unheard of before. Disappointed as a customer while flying out from India.",Disappointed as a customer
Emirates,"Terrible and rude staff, many of the staff were untrained and the trained staff were trained only to be rude and cut throat. Don’t believe the Emirates hype, this airline sucks.",Terrible and rude staff
Emirates,"I had the best flight experience, I flew DXB-SFO and return from IAD-DXB both flight were with the A380 with luxury semi suite in business class which convert to full flat bed. On both directions flights left on time and landed earl. Catering on board is 5 star standard and the best of the experience is the crew who were very attentive, always available and helping the passengers. Check in was smooth, boarding and disembarking a breeze and luggage were brought to belt so fast. I would like to thank the crew of EK225 on 20 May specially Ubaid and Christine and on my return EK232 on 17 June Danielle and the manager Rabih.",had the best flight experience
Emirates,"It was quickly apparent that Emirates were carrying out a savage cost cutting program. The Seating was impossibly cramped such that the first three days of my stay in the UK were spent in Warwick Hospital with a DVT. Food on the Plane was scarce and inedible, and drinks even scarcer. The Attendants did their best but were clearly hamstrung. It seems a very short sighted unimaginative approach will destroy a once admired Airline.",carrying out a savage cost cutting program
Emirates,"We were not well taken care of by the flight crew that departed from Dubai to São Paulo. Some of the attendants were rude. They spoke ill of the Brazilians who were on the flight. I was seated next to the crew cabin and I understood very well in English what they were talking about. I was extremely disappointed in the staff and company for management. Among other things more that left a lot to be desired. I have flights back to Sydney scheduled, but I don't know if I should cancel and return on another airline. Não fomos bem atendidos pela tripulação do voo que partiu de Dubai para São Paulo. Alguns dos atendentes foram grosseiros, rudes. Falaram mal dos brasileiros que estavam no voo. Eu estava sentado ao lado da cabine da tripulação e entendi muito bem em inglês o que eles estavam falando. Fiquei extremamente decepcionado com a equipe e empresa para a gestão. Entre outras coisas mais que ficou muito a desejar. Tenho voos de volta para Sydney programados, mas não sei se devo cancelar e retornar em outra companhia aérea.",I was extremely disappointed
Emirates,"At Algiers airport, the lounge is lifeless.  In the plane, the power receptacle is broken on my seat but luckily no one was sitting next to me to use his. The live TV did not work and the images are distorted. The live TV displays a few frames then freezes for a minute or so before displaying more frames. I was trying to watch the football game between ManU and Chelsea. The food (we were fasting) they left by your seat and then it took another 15 minutes to bring nuts and drinks after Maghrib. I just wanted soup for Iftar. In addition, when I was asked to choose my entree, it was not available. The seat I had 11A was very noisy. Usually they distribute pouches with socks, toothbrush and toothpaste and a blind mask in addition to ear plugs which would have been helpful. After all this is business class. The only bright thing in this upgrade is that the hostesses were brilliant and even tolerated my displeasure with these inconveniences in a nice way. In any case, this is the worst business class experience flying Emirates ever. Most likely it will be my last at least on this route. This is their reply: Dear Mr Boutrid, Thank you for your correspondence of 31 May 2022 regarding Emirates flight EK 758 from Algiers to Dubai on 28 April. I am concerned to learn of your disappointment with the lounge at Algiers airport. This lounge is operated by a service provider. Regrettably, not all lounge operators have the selection of food and beverages or ambience that we offer in our Emirates Lounges. However, your feedback is noted and has been shared with the relevant team for their information. Through emirates.com we do advise customers that for technical reasons we are unable to provide Wi-Fi, mobile phone, mobile data and live television services on every flight, or guarantee a continuous service. Emirates' liability is therefore limited. However, I acknowledge that this added to your disappointment. With regard to your request for the mixed grill, we always aim to match the quantity of choices with the predicted passenger preferences. While we do our utmost to meet all passenger requests, sometimes there may be shortages of a particular meal choice due to previous passenger selection. Shortages of a particular meal are continuously monitored in order to adjust ratios accordingly for future flights. It is my understanding that got your first choice of starter (potato soup), your preferred dessert, the chocolate caramel tarte, and opted for the beef meal instead. On another note, Business Class kit bags are offered on flights over 3 hours 30 minutes that depart between the hours of 22:00 to 05:00 and on all flights over 9 hours regardless of the departure time. However, certain toiletry items are available in the lavatories for the comfort of our passengers and may also be requested from our cabin crew. I regret that you did not enjoy our product offering as much as we would have liked.",the worst business class experience
Emirates,"It was a round trip with Emirates from Delhi to Dubai and antagonistic experience in both journeys. Ground staff at Dubai was very rude and unhelpful whereas in India the check in was way easier despite of huge rush. We were stuck and struggling for self check in (which we were guided again and again by the limited staff available) and finally after half an hour when our check in baggage got stuck on the belt and we again have to helplessly ask for help for which the lady at the counter replied us to wait for 2-3 minutes. After 10 minutes when nobody turned up my husband reminded the same lady at the counter that we need help to which she replied I am on some other report and we should proceed towards manual counter. We were shocked! My husband reminded her that our baggage is stuck to which she responded with irritation and called some technical staff to provide our baggage. Then we proceeded towards manual counter where again with technical glitches our check in was done in half an hour when all our documents were properly in place. In short more than an hour to check in at Dubai airport with Emirates without rush whereas in India within an hour we were done with check in, security and immigration! My suggestion to the passengers travelling from Emirates please don't expect soft spoken and helpful staff specially at Dubai airport and have spare time in hand to bear with the glitches.",antagonistic experience in both journeys
Emirates,"There was no email communication or phone call until this email response about my lost baggage from 21 May flight (EK 0071). Even the Emirates bag tracker website I was told to check has no record the bag arrived. Once I figured out about my bag, and Paris Airport staff said your bag is still in Sydney. Rubbish, expenses again and again, after 1 week  the Paris Emirates staff email me: Sir your bag is here in Paris. I was not in Paris already. I was in Amsterdam. I collected my bag prior my home flight from Paris to Sydney EK 074 - 4 June 2022.",expenses again and again
Emirates,"The worst, simply the worst. Flight attendants do not provide any service at all. Their info online contradicts what employees in airport are implementing. Headphones have an old plug so nothing fits but cheapest given. No human approach, no compassion, no apologies. Just everyone feels you owe them not the opposite. Bumped me with the child to next day regardless of the info online, them stick me in the last row seat since I gave them trouble, plus I did not have any time to purchase new seats for the next flight. Connection was 5 hrs when tickets were initially purchased, at the flight time became 17 hrs layover. Cheapest in everything.","The worst, simply the worst"
Emirates,"MXP-JFK-MXP in F. I found a solid product and comfort on board but service from the staff was just OK. There is a lack of personal touch throughout the whole flight experience from check-in procedure that was very cold both ways to the inflight mode. I always felt like an economy class pax on the ground both at check-in and in the lounge both in Italy & USA. Far different from what you feel flying QR in business for instance. Return flight on A6-EEA was disappointing because the aircraft was showing his age: my suite was completely worn out, sliding doors broken. EK should pay attention to this details and make sure everything is renewed especially in premium cabins where there is too much difference between aircraft to aircraft for A380's in their fleet. The food was very good quality in both legs. JFK-MXP flight was below average because of the service that was either too slow for the main meal or too rushed during breakfast. Shower SPA: both ways good experience the bathroom is huge with plenty of amenities and this is the real plus rather than the shower itself. Overall I think business class is the only product that worth the premium price for EK.",business class is the only product that worth the premium price for EK
Emirates,"Emirates services are getting worse day by day, I had my flight from Dubai to New York where i had my connecting flight for Nassau, which they changed the time and destination to Newark. The bag drop counter was closed, so I had to take all my luggage to the counter of JetBlue to checkin. When I reached Jet blue the attendants were not helpful at all said the counter is closed and my flight departure times has been changed from 7am to 10am. And they are unable to take my luggage and won't provide any accommodations that I should take my complaints to emirates counter. Emirates ground staff refused to help said I should contact customer service. As I did not have a USA number I had to use my roaming services to call Emirates customer service, after 45 mins being on call i was told that they cannot help and I need to contact ground staff of Emirates. When I went back to Emirates ground staff they said they can't do anything as it was their closing time. Not to mention my flight from Ewr to Nassau also kept getting delayed. I was stranded at the airport as I was not able to arrange a hotel because by the time I could finish all this run around and phone calls it was almost midnight. The only option to eat was dunkin donuts. Worst part was both Jetblue which was affiliated with Emirates and staff of Emirates did not showed any regrets. They cared less if I was being helped or directed. I bought my ticket from the website of Emirates and this was my worst experience ever. I will always avoid flying with this airline.",getting worse day by day
Emirates,"Rules are rules only if applied consistently. I travelled for a family death with only a carryon from Lax on Tues, 24th May, no problems. At Cochin on my way back on Sun, 29th May, they wouldn’t allow my carryon citing allowance limit. Didn’t have a second bag and had to carry my laptop and electronics in a duty free bag to LAX. Happy to comply with rules, but they can’t and shouldn’t be discriminatory. LAX and COK can’t have different rules for the same tickets and airlines. Many passengers in economy from COK were in violation of the number of carryons and weight limit as stated on the tickets. This was my first Emirates flight in many years and kind of reminded me why I prefer Qatar Airways / Singapore Airlines.",they wouldn’t allow my carryon
Emirates,"I had a flight to London Heathrow on EK007 on 25/05/2022 at 2.30am from Dubai. Reached airport 3 hours before and followed all proceedure till reaching the flight, also the seat was booked myself and paid extra for that. Nevertheless when I reached at flight EK007 my mom seat was under repair and technician was still working on it to fix due to seat mechanism was not working and again i had to wait for another 10 minutes in the flight but still it was not fixed and moving front and back without button. I  had to survive 7 hours with it. Informed flight attendant but only one apology, was not enough instead of upgrading or finding another seat. My experience was not at all good.",My experience was not at all good
Emirates,"This flight was Emirates back to its very best. Great service from the cabin crew, who were attentive, but also had a great sense of humour and seemed to be genuinely enjoying the flight. A light breakfast was served after departure from Dubai, with fresh fruits and breads. Lunch served about 2 hours before arrival into LHR. My wife and I chose the Fish tahta as a main course. This was roasted Kingfish in spicy rice, really tasty and generous portion. The Emirates Bar is a great feature on the A380 and we enjoyed a cocktail and a laugh and joke with the cabin crew. This really adds to the travel experience and is one of the features which makes travelling with Emirates a pleasant experience.",Great service from the cabin crew
Emirates,"Check In was quick and easy. Fast track security is offered for travellers in Business and First Class. Emirates use the Air Mauritius Les Salons Amedee Maingard lounge, which is ok but not the standard of a typical Emirates Lounge. Flight boarded and departed on time. As this is an overnight flight Emirates serve a dinner service soon after take-off. I had the Chicken Biryani, which was OK. Unfortunately for my wife, who was being served from the other aisle, their system failed and they forgot to serve my wife’s main course. Although very apologetic by the time they realised their mistake it was already getting late so my wife went without and just had the desert! Not ideal. Otherwise the flight was OK and landed on time into Dubai.",flight was OK and landed on time into Dubai
Emirates,"Miserable 6 hrs at Dubai thanks to Emirates. Took flight from JFK New York, with an hour delay, which caused missing my connecting flight which had 1:20 layover at Dubai but ended up with the next flight with 6 hrs hours wait at Dubai. Emirates had given us 'Food voucher' which could buy you a soup and water for 6 hrs wait at Dubai airport. Finally got on the next flight, not so impressive food but nice crew service though.",Miserable 6 hrs at Dubai
Emirates,"EK202 was delayed from JFK to pax annoyance, as a result missed connecting flight which I chose to have 1:20 hrs layover but now I'm waiting for almost 6 hrs at DXB. Other reasons, I was assigned different seat at JFK while I had pre-booked another one. Food wasn't impressive, Qatar Airways had better food a few weeks earlier on the same route, Crew was great. Full disclosure, at DXB a staff members waited near plane exit to direct passengers, handing new Boarding Pass and food vouchers. I'm still waiting for the next flight, and haven't checked airport voucher food yet (hope it won't restrict me to a Big Mac or some).",Food wasn't impressive
Emirates,Flight was redirected to Melbourne instead of Sydney and emirates left all passenger in Melbourne Airport on chairs for more than 6 hours. Emirates did not even provide food or hotel or even gave clear time when we will be traveling back to Sydney (Original Destination). Emirates service used to be a lot better. Will never ever use Emirates. I guess Emirates reach to a point that they do not care about their passengers.,they do not care about their passengers
Emirates,"Even though the flight was at 02-35 the Business Class lounge at the A gates was quite busy with limited seating. The bonus was boarding direct from the lounge. My seat was 14E was quite comfortable and the cabin crew offered supplementary mattresses. Passed on the initial meal service on this overnight flight. Breakfast was served prior to landing in Mauritius. Fruits were nice, I then tried the omelette, which was not brilliant. Flight landed on time and bags delivered promptly.",seat was 14E was quite comfortable
Emirates,"Our first flight since the pandemic. Check in at LGW was quick and efficient. Made our way to the Emirates lounge as we had a couple of hours to spare. Service was good in the lounge and after about 15 minutes they served a hot lunch. The Goan Chicken Curry was pleasant. Flight boarded and departed on time. My wife and I had seats 14E and 14F which are ideal for a couple travelling together. At the time of travel masks were mandatory, Emirates provided spare masks and sanitizer. The food service on Emirates used to be quite drawn out but with the new system they take the meal selection from the passengers on a hand held device and it seems to be delivered in quite an efficient manner. I chose the Arabic Mezze, which was very tasty followed by the Beef Tenderloin, which was also good. Good choice of wine available. Emirates only serve one meal on the flight from Gatwick to Dubai, which we found to be sufficient. Snacks and sandwiches are available at any time, either delivered to your seat or from the bar. Overall a very good flight with Emirates.",a very good flight with Emirates
Emirates,"Superb service from Emirates. I had to cancel my flight due to illness only 2 weeks before departure and phoned the Lisbon office. After pressing 2 buttons I was talking to a rep after less than 2 minutes. Much to my surprise, for a base ticket, he said I was entitled to a refund and sent me a refund form. Nothing arrived for a month so I again phoned and the mistake I had made in completing the refund form was explained and another sent. After only 2 weeks a partial refund for 'no show' was credited to my account and when I queried why 'no show' for a cancellation I received an apologetic mail confirming full refund which duly arrived after only 10 days. This compares with Ryanair who will fight tooth and nail to avoid any, even legitimate, refund. Guess where my loyalties will lie in future - Emirates!",Superb service from Emirates
Emirates,"A business trip from Sydney to Zurich and then back to Brisbane, code share with Qantas. Things that impressed me included the superb food and wine on all sectors (incl a nice printed menu and wine list), the wonderful Emirates First Class Lounges in Dubai (especially their prime lounge), the speedy and efficient boarding and the good cabin crews. Not so good was trying to get to a toilet in the middle of the night and having to make my way past lots of drunken passengers filling the bar area at the back of the A380 - which is also the area where the toilets are. I suggest this Lounge area could be made a barista coffee lounge instead (as much as I like a glass of wine). All flights pretty much on time. Compared with a recent Singapore Airlines business flight, Emirates were ahead in the food and wine area.",superb food and wine
Emirates,"Only the second time I choose to fly Emirates, so I will not make a fast decision as to use this airline again or not. But I have to say that in all the years I have been flying business, the CDG - DXB sector was a complete disgrace. From the chaotic boarding in Paris when all first and business class passengers were held at the gate for 25 minutes (apparently for no reasons except that some sort of VIP showed up at some point and cut the line), without so much as an announcement from the person in charge. Once everyone was on board, the first announcement from the captain was about an hour delay in getting a takeoff slot. As we pushed back, their APU went out, no lights and aircon and back to the gate. Then some very vague information from the flight deck on some repairs being done, and another slot waiting time. Anyway the whole deal lasted 3 hours. Ok, that is a technical problem, it happens and that is the way it is. What bothered me during the whole time was the complete disdain of the cabin crew for the passengers. As a matter of facts, most of them seemed to enjoy the delay and were having some very long and loud conversations with some apparent friends in the aisles. The flight finally took off. And this is when the cabin crew showed its complete inability to handle the most basic service. Absolutely no care for the passengers, and except for some meal served in a hurry (during which I actually had to beg for a glass of wine previously ordered ) we only got to see them once in a while during the whole 7,5 hours. I want to think that this was a bad timing, or else. On the other end, the second leg of the flight from DXB to Moscow was excellent, and I actually found out how much was missing on the first leg then: Friendly and helpful cabin crew, good service. After all this is what we ask for in a flight! My rating will be below at 5/10. Zero for first leg, 10 for second leg.",CDG - DXB sector was a complete disgrace
Emirates,"I am retired and fly frequently. Couple days ago (May 5), I went to Tehran Int. Airport (IKA) to travel to U.S.A. When I arrived at the Emirate ticketing counter in order to obtain my boarding pass, I experienced a bad situation which I have never had with any other airlines. The ticketing lady had a very bad attitude told me to show her my Covid test result which I did, then asking for Vaccination card that I responded that I am USA citizen and there is no need to have this card, which she started talking loud and being so rude, finally I found my card and passed it to her. After that I was glad that the issue was resolved and now she would process my luggage. I was wrong. She laid back at her chair and doing nothing. Finally I said to her this checking takes long time, please process my luggage. At the end I went to her team leader and explained her behavior. I am sure that the leader would not do anything to correct his group attitudes, because all of them are the same and they do not know any better, but I am sure that Emirates will lose more customers as times pass. From now on, I will broadcast and pass this bad experience to my friends and relatives and telling them not to fly with Emirates.",telling them not to fly with Emirates
Emirates,"They cancelled my initial flight from KHI to DXB and rebooked the flights which ended up me having 15 hours layover in Dubai. KHI-DXB, check in was friendly, flight was on time, clean plane, food was outstanding for a flight not even 2 hours long, crew was very friendly and attentive. Blankets and extra pillow were given. Landed in Dubai, went to the Dubai connect desk as it says on their website that if you have more than 10 hours layover, Emirates will provide you accommodation, at the desk, the guy was rude and straight up said Karachi office should have booked you earlier (Karachi office is the one that told me to contact Emirates at Dubai as they have no authority to book anything with Dubai Connect) and I was also told that even a prior booking was made, it would have been cancelled because accommodation is only available for passengers who bought tickets worth more than $1000 USD. Then I went back to the connection desk, explained the whole situation all over again, guy at the desk started blaming me that I am the one who chose to have a longer layover so it's not Emirates problem, he kept ignoring that key information that Emirates is the one who cancelled the flight from KHI to DXB, not me. I have to admit, I became a Karen when he told me Emirates can't offer you anything, no compensation no food, nothing for a 15 hours layover. I refused to listen to him any further and demanded to see a manager right away, he ran back and got the manager at the desk, manager was extremely polite and apologetic, instructed to hand me over 2 meal vouchers immediately (previously I was told Emirates do not have any meal voucher offers etc, so that was the lie). So guys, if you want to be treated fairly by Emirates, you gotta fight hard. DXB to CDG, flight was on-time, full. Crew was very attentive, plane was spotless, food was disgusting. They served feta cheese sandwiches, they were absolutely inedible and were freezing cold as well that it hurts you teeth. Then the lights were switch off so it was good sleep with enough legroom. Breakfast was served an hour before landing and main hot breakfast was inedible as well, fruit portion was fresh but the bread roll was so cold that I couldn't slice or bite it (should learn from Turkish, they serve soft warm rolls). I have also noticed many people didn't eat the hot portion of the breakfast. I have to give a shout-out to one particular crew member, she handled the situation very well when she was yelled at by a grumpy middle age man when she asked him, if he would like to have a breakfast, he started yelling at her that no, I'm sleeping, can you see, stop yelling into my ears. Honestly I wanted to intervene but there was no need to as she handled it quite well but I can tell, he kinda ruined her day.","if you want to be treated fairly by Emirates, you gotta fight hard"
Emirates,"Emirates has been using the 777 to serve HKG ever since the start of the pandemic, it used to be the A380. The 777 has a strange business class configuration of 2x3x2. Who wants to be the unlucky fellow to sit in the middle of the 3, paying premium price? The service is OK but not great either. Food was as bland as ever, the seat is really narrow and uncomfortable. OK for a short to medium haul flight up to about 6 hours, anything longer than that would be an ordeal. Still, one redeeming grace is that, they sell this short leg at a very attractive price, so that is acceptable.",seat is really narrow and uncomfortable
Emirates,"Flight was full. They forced me to check in my single piece of hand luggage while hundreds of other passengers carry in their 2 pieces. No process of asking customers for checking in their carry-ons, but they just randomly forced me.",forced me to check in my hand luggage
Emirates,"Ok, I have not even started my journey yet and they cancelled my Karachi - Dubai flight, re-booked me (without even consulting with me) and I ended up with a new booking which means, instead of landing in Paris at 9am in the morning, I will be landing at 2pm. I have booked this trip in Jan, already paid for a domestic flight from Paris to Lyon that departs from Paris at noon on a same day I land there. Called Emirates, explained them the whole situation, even sent them a receipt of 100 euro plane (non-refundable) ticket I have already bought from Paris to Lyon, all they said, sorry, but that's not our problem if you gonna miss your connecting flight to Lyon. I kept on insisting that I must take the original schedule flight from DXB to CDG as planned so they must fix it. After a long argument, I am good to fly but with 15 hours layover at Dubai. I asked them for an accommodation through Dubai connect program, they refused to book anything or even provide a meal voucher (like Qatar Airways) reasoning that I am the one choosing to not to fly to Paris on immediate available connection, therefore, no accommodation or food for you. Their telephone rep people are so rude (not the Karachi one, Dubai helpline), literally telling me they don't care if I'm going to miss my connecting flight and that's not Emirates headache. Will provide an update on this journey once I will land in Paris. Stay tuned.",I ended up with a new booking
Emirates,"On reading all the post COVID reviews of Emirates, I need to take a contrary stance to all the complaints and mumbles. It was my first Emirates experience in 3 years, and as far as I was concerned nothing had changed, apart from the boarding procedure in Dubai which was nothing short of shambolic - but that is the airport, not the airline. As a direct result of the ineptitude of the gate staff we pushed back 1 hour 20 mins late. No matter. The service was friendly and efficient - nothing was too much trouble - and the food and drink really good. One doesn’t often have memorable meals on board any aircraft (preparation of same must be trying in the extreme), but the lunch served was top notch. A bonus in business class on board an A380 is the on board bar area, once again, service was excellent. I had a thoroughly enjoyable experience and look forward to my next Emirates experience.",The service was friendly and efficient
Emirates,"Purchased online extra leg room seats (weeks before) my flight. 150$ each way. (300$) Not only did I not get my seats, they refuse to reimburse my money. They claim I was ineligible for the seat (yet I was charged online?). They claim I was informed at check-in that I wasn’t eligible for the seat (lie) not informed at check-in. I had informed the cabin attendant my seat was wrong and that I paid extra money for my seat (and showed her my printed paperwork). They weren’t concerned. I looked at my original seat and someone else was seating in my seat. They charge me for a seat I didn’t get, then RE-SOLD my seat to someone else. I was traveling with a group and the same thing happened to my co-traveler. They’re stealing customers money! Do not buy X-leg room seats!",Do not buy X-leg room seats!
Emirates,"Bad behaviour by staff. Started heckling me because I could not hear the announcement at JFK. Same happened when I was flying from Dubai to New York last week. I pulled my mask down to ask for water while being seated window side, and the crew started questioning me why have I pulled my mask down. Rest during 13hrs of flight time from Dubai to JFK, I could find half of the people sleeping without masks.",questioning me why have I pulled my mask down
Emirates,"The flight commenced boarding 20 minutes prior to departure time. The gate lounge was jammed full with no space to sit or stand. A small boy vomited on the floor in the gate area. I informed an Emirates ground agent to call a cleaner and was given a blank stare. Passengers walked through the vomit and no clean-up was done. Boarding was unorganized with no sense of order. The aircraft pushed back approximately two hours after departure time. An announcement was made by a pilot stating the delay was due to 'baggage handling technical problems.' The digital menu was not working. I asked a cabin crew what was on the menu, and they stated to ask another crew member. Toilets were not clean and were smelly. I requested a drink in the galley from a cabin crew and he pointed to cups and a bottle of water and said 'get it yourself.' Cabin temperature was freezing cold. The seat was comfortable. Baggage arrived on two separate baggage carousels in SYD. This made baggage collection complicated and confusing. Overall, a comfortable flight but nothing special. I have had better on-time performance, service, and cabin cleanliness from low cost carriers.",comfortable flight but nothing special

Emirates,"Well it seems a post-Covid Emirates is a very different airline and a different experience to beforehand. The previous high quality service, little touches that made you feel a valued customer and friendly attendants onboard are all gone, vanished. Instead they've replaced this with grumpy attendants who don't pay attention to the customer, little things like noticing a low drink and filling it up before you have to ask, welcoming returning loyal customers - these are the things you pay for with Emirates and in Business class, now it might as well be a long Ryanair flight. They have lost all the caring aspects that gave them an edge, if you are going to fly to the middle east then use Qatar or even Turkish. Their seats are still comfy as anything, I'll give them that.",They have lost all the caring aspects that gave them an edge
Emirates,"The day before I was scheduled to fly back to the states, I tested positive for covid. I called Emirates and they said I would be unable to fly back but that they could keep my ticket and place it on hold. When I went to change the date to fly back, they made me pay the fare difference. In this case, the cheapest fare difference I could get within a two week period was $400. How an airline can you charge you for getting covid is insane. I’m so disappointed and upset. Their customer service team on the phone was awful. I will never fly with Emirates again after this experience. I didn’t ask for covid, and got financial punished for it.",I’m so disappointed and upset
Emirates,"First Emirates flight ever. Food was served on a tray mis sized to the seat tray so difficult to keep in place. Food was hot but otherwise tasteless. Food for special orders is served 15 to 30 minutes before beverage cart comes by so only water on tray available to consumer. I paid extra for better seats but given the service and noise environment, it probably was a waste. Cabin is drafty, video headsets do not fit anyone, noise during my flights (esp. to SEA) was excessive. Airline does not address selected and/or comfortable seating for passengers with infants. Four infants on my flight were training talk show hosts as their lungs and screams lasted the entire 15 hour flight to SEA. The plane was full and staff gave little concern for passengers. On arrival in SEA the airline took forever (1.5 hours) to get luggage to customer even though I had a first class luggage tag on my one bag. Onward booking by airline had incorrect boarding info for ongoing flight and barely made the connection. Cannot imagine what others waited and how many missed connections. Yes, SEA is an airport to avoid for customs and general connection flights. But airline is responsible for getting luggage unloaded and Emirates failed customers but staff luggage was first off and first picked up. I will never fly Emirates ever. The problems were not a full plane or infants, the problem was the airline treating their customers like cattle and not taking action to address an unrestful environment.",the problem was the airline treating their customers like cattle
Emirates,"This was the worst experience that I've ever had with any company. My flight from NY to Dubai was delayed. After arriving late to Dubai for my connection flight to Male, I was informed by Emirates staff to go to luggage claims to get my luggage for my next emirates flight to Male. My luggage never came through after 40 mins. I informed an Emirates employee and they claimed that my luggage was already loaded onto my next flight. Upon going through customs, I missed my flight, so I was stuck in Dubai. I was forced to wait in 3 different long lines for a total of 5 hrs, just to be told that because I was a no show, I had to pay a $1200 fee. I informed the Emirates representative of what happened and they became rude and walked away. After 5 hrs I was able to speak to someone who understood situation and got me a next morning flight for my destination of Male. Upon receiving my new flight I was stranded in the airport for 17hrs before my 2:30am flight. On my original flight I paid for a extra legroom seat, but on the rescheduled flight I was forced to sit in a standard seat that really hurt my legs. After taking the grueling flight to Male, my luggage never came. I reported the incident to Male airport staff and they started an investigation for my luggage. I finally was able to take a transfer to maldives, but without any clothes or luggage. This entire situation ruined my vacation because this was over the weekend. So I'm at a resort with no change of clothes, and no toiletries. Emirates airlines turned my dream vacation into a nightmare. I will never fly with Emirates again with the rude, disrespectful employees.","rude, disrespectful employees"
Emirates,"Lost an item on the plane and the staff were very incompetent and nonchalant, did not go the extra mile which these airlines market themselves on. The supervisor was inept and repetitive throughout the process and the captain who was also present in the discussion came across as if he was in a military arbitration. All in all very dissatisfied and won’t be flying with them again.",won’t be flying with them again
Emirates,"My nine-month-old daughter and I had a trip with Emirates in February 2018, and for my daughter's convenience, I paid extra to go and sit in the front row seat, but during the flight, the flight attendant took my and my daughter's luggage and put it in the last cabin of the plane, which was very difficult for me. I was going and picking up the things my little daughter needed and I was very annoyed but they did not pay attention and when I got off the plane I was the last passenger to get off because I was waiting for them to take my luggage from the bottom of the plane and give it to me and my daughter. It was my last trip with this airline.",my last trip with this airline
Emirates,"We were eligible for Dubai connect service wherein we would be accommodated for the duration of our 9 hour transit in Dubai if we have a connecting Emirates flight. I was travelling for the first time with my newborn and with covid being stressful enough and all the paperwork required to travel, Emirates whipped up a whammy by not arranging for me transit visa even after I organised this a month in advance as directed by Emirates Dubai connect. Their incompetence gave me a hard time travelling with my baby who was very tired after a long flight and since we trusted Emirates notifications, we got to the airport desk to find out our visas were not organised and had to wait 2 hours in the airport for this. I could have easily paid for my visa weeks in advance and had a hassle free experience but even with repeated enquiries with Emirates customer service, I was told the visa was complimentary and not to worry about it. Truly horrifying experience and they never managed to compensate their messing up with anything. I had to pay for my airport hotel stay as we were not willing to wait two hours for just visa processing and then going out of the airport for their complimentary stay. Also, the fact that Dubai airport is so huge makes things more difficult with a baby to be walking a lot. All in all, very bad experience and would not recommend Emirates.",Truly horrifying experience
Emirates,"The crew in the plane were courteous and smiling. Not the same for their ground counterparts. It was during Covid and they served your needs according to your passport. I had a 13h layover in Dubai. They refused to let me use their lounge. Interestingly enough, my friend who was flying with an American passport was given accommodation within the airport. He had a 10h layover unlike me who had 13. The said crew would served you according to the passport you were flying with. Unbelievable humans. I’m never flying Emirates. They made me feel less than!",I’m never flying Emirates
Emirates,"I was flying Emirates out of Houston on 29th November 2021 and i had purchased extra luggage. When i got there i was told it was per piece not per KG and i had to pay more. i agreed and tried to give them cash, they refused and insisted that i must pay by credit card which i did not have, eventually an argument ensued and their assistant mgr came and instead of resolving the conflict, he told me not to board the flight and i left. I have been asking for my refund from Emirates and they said i did not meet their conditions of carriage because of an argument.  I was perplexed and i have been asking for my refund and they provided no proof whatsoever to back up their claims.  I am still asking for my money or a new ticket from Emirates. Customer Affairs asked me to contact their security which i did and the security said it had nothing to do with them. They were essentially giving me the run around instead of being professional. The agent asked me to go ahead and claim a refund for the unused sector which i did but was denied, i have sent her multiple mails and she does not respond to emails or calls. Emirates customer affairs are extremely unprofessional. Emirates is not a good airline and their service is sub-par at best.",customer affairs are extremely unprofessional
Emirates,"What a pity this well funded airline is so poorly managed. Food is very mediocre (chicken tikka masala with rice on both legs of my journey inbound and outbound!) and planes are tired. The food service comes on a night flight after 3 hours when people are asleep. Today I have been waiting for over 2.5 hours for luggage in Heathrow london. These glitches can happen but there is not a representative in sight. Customer service needs some retraining. Passenger in wheelchairs, kids all falling asleep on the halted conveyor belt, and still no help from Emirates.",Customer service needs some retraining
Emirates,"I have flown Emirates for 30 years and have found them always to a decent standard however this flight was a touch sub par, my seat 7B was broken and did not fully lie flat and given this was a night flight of 6 hours not a good start. The crew were very pleasant and attentive but one passenger was on a cellphone and largely reclined until take off and I had to ask crew to silence him, on landing he refused to wear a mask to cover fully his face and another passenger complained and I asked a steward to intervene. Otherwise an ok flight.",this flight was a touch sub par
Emirates,"EK020, 26/01, Evening flight, easy good check-in but soon became aware afternoon flight had been cancelled so they were amalgamating flights. A380 gate at MAN is always hard work but this was totally chaotic with ground staff failing to get a grip. We queued for 20 mins to board but found we were in the wrong queue, the one to get reallocated from the cancelled flight. This was because staff failed to tell anyone what was going on. 90 mins late we took off, full flight. It was ok but the number of babes in arms crying meant no sleep, food was the usual but due to being full it was slow. On arrival we were all herded without announcement for an additional no option PCR test which was also chaotic, although it was free. Return flight EK19 on 10/02 was better serviced, on time and food was better but yet again the crying babes meant no sleep whatsoever. Bottom line is the A380 gate at MAN is still not fit for purpose and because of the popularity of those with very young children we won't be rushing back.",A380 gate at MAN is still not fit for purpose
Emirates,"Flight EK073. Extremely pleasant experience. Super friendly staff, especially flight attendant name Kylarah and Lithuanian flight attendant.",Extremely pleasant experience
Emirates,"My family was flying from Male to Dubai and it was our worst flight ever. At the beginning everything was ok but when the plane took off they put AC on and it got extremely cold. As we and many other people on this plane were flying from hot country to hot country nobody was thinking to put on any warm clothes, the only one thing that was helping everyone were the blankets. I did inform the flight attendant twice but they didn’t do anything with that. Maybe there are some areas on the plane where it is not that cold but they didn’t offer us any help though we had a baby and baby was cold. We fly a lot and such situation has never ever happened to us. Crazy freezing flight. The company doesn’t care about the costumers. Service was not good as well. From now on will choose any other options not to get this experience again with the Emirates.",our worst flight ever
Emirates,"We had the most horrific experience with Emirates travelling from Spain to Sydney. Our flight was delayed by an hour from Barcelona. We let the crew know multiple times that we had a connection to catch. They told us not to worry, there'll be ground crew waiting for us once we land and will make sure we don't miss our connection. But #Emirates had already cancelled our next flight after an hr into our seven 7 hr flight, this was 6 hrs before landing. Once we landed there was no crew waiting so we ran to catch the connection until mid-way the #Emirates personnel appeared telling us about the cancellation. They're rude and ignorant to the fact that we were sleep deprived, tired and could not grasp why no effort was made to make up for the 1 hour delay or contact the ground crew. Also both my partner & I had picked up a cold virus (not Covid, got the negative PCR) and felt horrible. We were both feverish, barely managing to speak and the crew treated us poorly. First they gave us seats far away from each other twice. I couldn't understand how they could make the same mistake twice. Second they told us we can't get the exit row seat, we'd paid extra for. They told me, it wasn't their responsibility to refund the money and I should request if from Emirates.  I just requested that we wouldn't be seated near any small babies and they said fine. They kept telling us to collect our luggage, but with the condition my partner and I were in and the fact that my feet had already started swelling up, it was impossible. So we said no. Since no one was helping and it was 3 am, we thought to go and check in to our hotel & sleep. We were already at our limits but thought we make the best of it, go visit the Dubai Expo and all. But things just started getting worst. We were in nightmarish state until we got home. We had to walk for an hour to get to the shuttle that would take us to the hotel. The Emirates crew at the Airport entrance couldn't help us with Expo tickets, cause they didn't care. We had been given one meal voucher per person for 24 hours. And the hotel had no amenities. After multiple arguments, the meal problem was fixed, which wasn't that useful cause the quality of the food was so bad that all the passengers in the hotel were ordering deliveries. We'd to go and buy clothes, toothbrush, deodorant, etc for ourselves which was a waste of money. The hotel couldn't even be rated at 2 stars and there was always at least one person arguing and shouting with the staff and complaining. We survived the whole ordeal and got to the plane to find couple of things that we were assured were fine, were actually not. We ended being seated beside a baby that cried for 10 hours of our flight without exaggeration, there were empty seats at the end of the plane, they just didn't bother to check for us. I did ask for a change of seat at the gate and in flight and every time I was told there were no empty seats. We arrived at Syd airport in a chaotic situation to collect our luggage. They'd given the wrong belt, so everyone spent an hour at luggage collection.",the most horrific experience
Japan Airlines,"The crew were great on both flights, very kind and helpful. Lounge access was great too! The seats were not that comfortable, inflight entertainment system not great, neither was the food. Considering the approx. 50% premium I paid for Premium Economy over the economy fare, I am less than satisfied. On the way back, Japan Airlines mishandled one of my bags in Osaka (not a very busy international airport), and got it a day later.",“crew were great on both flights”
Japan Airlines,"I flew back to Tokyo Haneda out of London Heathrow in Business Class on New Year’s Day with JL 42. Unfortunately, it was not until 3 days before that I knew that I had been downgraded to Business from First because of plane change. My new plane was set to have no First Class. The services on board they offered me, however, reversed the unexpected. A chief purser assigned me a seat with next one empty. For dinner I opted for Japanese cuisine. After the first course was completed, I proposed that I should alter for Western cuisine. A flight attendant accepted it without hesitation and willingly served me a beef fillet steak as the main course, the sauce of which tasted a hint of Japanese soy sauce. I was only too happy to find my favorite Japanese sake on the beverage menu, Imanishi, brewed in Sakurai, Nara Prefecture. Also how lucky to discover a very palatable Bordeaux on board! I slept tight on a wide flatbed, which left nothing to be desired, until 2 hours prior to landing. Then I took some refreshments featuring cheese and fruits, naturally along with the Bordeaux. Japan Airlines helps passengers arrive in better shape.",happy to find my favorite Japanese sake
Japan Airlines,"Japan Airlines is no doubt best airline in the world and deserve a 6 star rating (as it is better than many of the 5 star airlines on Skytrax). The thing standing out is the service of the cabin attendants. They are always very polite, efficient and have a great attention to details (eg when they see bathroom on the other aisle is vacant, they will direct passengers to the empty bathroom). Seat pitch is wide, but the sky wider seat has poor padding. I would say Japan Airlines has built in a lot of service elements based on Asian preference - if you are not an Asian or are more comfortable sticking with the western style (say food or move options, or you are just a fan of alcohol), then you will be disappointed.",“a great attention to details”
Japan Airlines,"I was able to secure a Business Class ticket for a very good price and it was such a nice journey. Service is top notch which is expected from JAL and the seat was comfortable. My only drawback is the weight policy for the baggage which allows only 20 KG for checked baggage (even for J Class) and as a hardcore shopper, I ended up paying ¥6000 for extra weight. This is not always a good option for me and I would rather fly with ANA to take advantage of their piece policy which allows 2 pieces 23 KG each for economy.",paying ¥6000 for extra weight
Japan Airlines,"Great service, the crews were attentive and have been walking around throughout the whole flight to ensure that customers are comfortable and you can call them if you need anything. Good amount of legroom and wide selection of movies, some of which are pretty recent. The crews also keep going back and forth offering drinks and snacks which was cool. Though legroom is good but the width of the seat is a little too narrow. The taste of the food has many room for improvement. Quality of the entrainment screen can be improved as well.",crews were attentive
Japan Airlines,"All announcements were primarily in Japanese and the stewards barely spoke or understood English. They announced two main meal choices. By the time they got to me, only one was available, a curry-based meal. I couldn't bare the thought of eating something like that. There were no other choices and I politely refused.  Later, they came around with a pastry and choice of tea or other drinks. I asked for coffee and had to ask three times for my cup of coffee. And during our breakfast they chose not to retrieve my tray until all other passengers were cared for. Stewards kept passing by and looking at my empty tray, but wouldn't attempt to grab it. I would not recommend this airline.",had to ask three times for my cup of coffee
Japan Airlines,"A mediocre business class experience both to and from Tokyo. Sky suite III was tight, claustrophobic and uncomfortable. Only 1 meal service for a 10 hour flight, the rest is on demand. I ordered 'western option' for lunch which was beef cooked so rare I couldn't eat it. After 45 mins reheating it hadn't improved. The 'Japanese option' was no longer available. On demand offerings included a stodgy vegetable curry or noodles so I settled for a ham and cheese panini which did not meet my expectation of a business class lunch on a long haul flight. Service was friendly but after meal service crew disappeared though they did respond to passengers ordering drinks etc.  The return flight was just as bad. After 3 1/2 hours into a 10 hour overnight flight the cabin lights were still on because they hadn't finished the meal service. Lights then came on 2 hours before landing which is ridiculous when passengers are trying to sleep. Again, only one meal service with rare beef the western option. There was nothing available vaguely resembling breakfast food to choose before landing at 6.25am and when I asked, I was pointed to lasagna. Last orders anyway are 2 hours before landing so, again, only limited time to sleep. Cabin announcements were inaudible and there was no information from the cockpit. The cabin was kept hot throughout the flight. Boarding at Haneda was by bus and a shambles. There aren't enough buses and the flight was nearly an hour late taking off but no information provided or updates. This was our first time with JAL and it most certainly will be our last.",beef cooked so rare I couldn't eat it
Japan Airlines,"2 1/2 hours before departure of JAL flight to Hawaii we realized my wife left her purse on the bullet train. It contained passports as well as iPhone, credit cards, cash and drivers license. With great good fortune, the Shinkansen train staff located the purse and we retrieved it and caught the monorail to Haneda Airport, arriving about 10 inutes prior to fight departure. The gracious ladies at the JAL counter checked us in and guided us through passport control and then through the security line intended for airline flight crews. Then, one of the counter ladies walked us quickly directly to the gate, where we arrived several minutes prior to flight departure. We boarded the plane and began to breathe again. We will be forever grateful to the JAL staff for their help.",forever grateful to the JAL staff
Japan Airlines,"Check in through the app and baggage drop at the airport were easy. The lounge was comfortable with a reasonable spread of food and drink and great views of the runway. Boarding was well organised and the on-board service was friendly and efficient. The food (between us we had the Japanese and vegetarian options) was delicious. The seat was narrow and with limited storage options, but comfortable enough. The flight operated on time and baggage appeared quickly. A good experience.",food was delicious
Japan Airlines,"Very smooth flights, operated by J-Air. Online check-in and even check-in at the airport using the normal booking reference number were not available (these flights were booked using Qantas points). However, the counter staff at both locations were efficient and found the reservation quickly. The boarding by zones process worked well, and onboard service of drinks was friendly. The seat was a little narrow. The flights operated exactly on time and baggage was quick to appear. Compared to a recent JAL Business Class domestic flight, the service, beverage and check-in process were identical and it's hard to see why one would take JAL Business Class within Japan.",Very smooth flights
Japan Airlines,"Although the seats are comfortable and the service is efficient, this is a rather basic domestic Business Class product compared with domestic flights of similar length in other countries. Seating on the Boeing 737 is 3-2 across with old style seating. I was denied access to the domestic Business lounge because I was not a status frequent flyer member. Although this was a lunchtime flight scheduled at 2½ hrs there was no meal service, only a cup of tea. The flight operated on time and luggage was quick to appear. As often happens on JAL, the captain was silent throughout the flight.",basic domestic Business Class product

Japan Airlines,Bangkok to Tokyo-Narita. I have never seen this type of customer service and hospitality in any airline in my life. Thank you very much for your staff and friendly customer service. This is the best customer service I have ever received from an airline in my life .Throughout of the journey (6 hours and 20 minutes) I Have enjoyed the Smile of the staff. Superb !! Superb!,friendly customer service
Japan Airlines,"Japan Airlines no longer serve late night snack / porridge as compared to 10 years ago there are no meal options for you onboard unless you pre-book your meal online for dietary needs. Breakfast is decent from Tokyo - Singapore, serving sausage & macaroni 2 before landing. The seats are comfortable but I found lice in the pillow case. In-flight screen is very dated and menu is not user friendly. The service is deteriorated as compared to before.",no longer serve late night snack
Japan Airlines,"Overall pretty nice considering the reasonable price too. Staff and Sakura lounge great. Selection of drinks is very limited. So is the selection of movies/entertainment- terrible, almost non-existing. Wifi didn’t work. And is charged extra which is not great, especially since all domestic JAL flights have complimentary wifi. Cabin was clean though not very clean. The seat is very comfy when you sleep, however really far from the screen and when you eat it’s just somewhat awkward.",Overall pretty nice
Japan Airlines,"At Changi, despite still being 5 hours prior to departure, the ground staff team let me check in early, and I was glad that I did even though I had checked in online because the process took quite a long time due to this being a US-bound flight. Eventually, I was sent through the automated gates of passport control, and after some rest, I made it to the gate. Boarding was made on time, and strangely, neither I nor my other family members was allowed to accompany our travel party who needed wheelchair assistance, something that was not the case on the Haneda-Los Angeles leg. Having purchased this ticket through American Airlines, JAL and AA made a miscommunication that eventually led to me and my other family members being seated separately from each other on the Singapore-Haneda leg of the trip, but I believe that was a fluke because the seats on the Haneda-Los Angeles leg was set correctly. What I got on both legs were friendly cabin crew despite the agonizingly long duration of the flight, sumptuous meals, in-flight entertainment system with a great selection of contents and old-school but easy-to-use layout, wide legroom and seat width for economy class, friendly ground staff service on all airports, and adequately air-conditioned cabin and mood lighting. I arrived early at Haneda but arrived late in Los Angeles, and on the latter flight, the crews just couldn't stop apologizing for the delay, something seemingly textbook when it comes to Japanese culture but very appreciated. When one of my family member's IFE system stopped working, the flight attendant, as a gesture of apology, gave him another form of in-flight entertainment through the very stable in-flight wi-fi. Overall, I would surely try JAL again, and I have never said this before - but I learned a lot from this airline. I hope other airlines can also learn from JAL, too, because I can confidently say without a shadow of a doubt that both flights, SIN-HND and HND-LAX, are my all-time best so far. No wonder they're a 5-star airline and in the top 5 best airlines in the 2023 list.",both flights are my all-time best
Japan Airlines,"I sat at seat 1K next to the galley and the lack of service/attention I received on my flight from Narita to Frankfurt was astonishing. Outside of the main meal, I was ignored for almost the entire flight. I slept 6 hours after they served lunch (after takeoff) and I woke up to find that the cabin attendants had not picked up my trash (napkins/empty water bottle). You might think this is not to disturb me, but I left it on the mini counter that was on the outside of my suite. After I woke up and for the remainder of the flight, they never walked up to me willingly and asked me if I needed anything.  I had to use the flight attendant call button to ask for one of the meals you can order anytime on JAL. What astonished me is the cabin attendant pretended to forget to serve the meal to me.  The head cabin attendant came to apologize to me and I told her I still wanted the meal because I haven't had anything to eat since the lunch after takeoff. She should have already guessed that also, since 12-13 hours had elapsed at that point in time. She still did not serve me the meal though. I landed at my final destination extremely hungry, which is something that has never happened to me on any business class flight, especially long-haul ones!",did not serve me the meal
Japan Airlines,"Flew from Manila to Tokyo and JAL regional from Tokyo to Sapporo. The flight was quite pleasant and seamless from the the check in to the flight itself. Food is usually a chore on airlines but I really enjoy JALs offerings. I don't really have complaints for any part of the trip since they really make it seamless for you. I guess I would just like more international connectivity as their domestic flights already have wifi, I wish they could offer (even with a fee) wifi for international flights and perhaps keep it free for domestic.",flight was quite pleasant and seamless
Japan Airlines,It is always a pleasure to fly on Japan Airlines. The check in at Haneda International is always seamless with JAL. The 10 hour plane ride to Los Angeles was very nice. The stewardess was awesome and food was very good. JAL tends to be a little more expensive but it is always worth the money. I would always recommend to use JAL when traveling to Japan.,it is always worth the money
Japan Airlines,"I am more than disappointed in the overall quality and service on JAL. Our family has flown internationally many many times and have never experienced the terrible customer service that we did on this flight. Our initial route out from Chicago-Tokyo-Bangkok was in Business Class for all 4 of us. The food was absolutely terrible and the flight attendants were not the nicest. On our return trip we were split up with 2 of us being in economy. My daughter (4 yo) and I sat in economy and I actually cried because I was so upset with the entire staff. They refused to give my 4 year old and snacks or ice cream that they passed out to every person on the plane. Their excuse was that she ordered a special meal so she couldn’t get anything else. Well everyone else on that plane that ordered a special meal still got many snacks and ice cream. The “special “ meal was absolutely disgusting. I wouldn’t have given it to an animal. It was not distinguishable in any way and they gave her fish with cheese sauce as the “bland meal” along with raw onion and pepper salad. The flight attendants also didn’t serve her any drinks without me having to almost berate them. They said no one was allowed to switch seats and I couldn’t trade with my husband up in business either, yet the man sitting right next to me was given the bulk head seat alone with no one next to him after our flight took off. Every single flight attendant on the flight was the worst I’ve experienced in all my international travel. We will absolutely NEVER fly on JAL again.",more than disappointed
Japan Airlines,"It seems they are holding out for their new A350's before providing a proper service to business class passengers. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful. The seats were old and worn. Flight was delayed one hour due to an IFE technical problem. JAL don't communicate their meal service too well, so left waiting or wondering what the plan is and communication of baggage procedures in Tokyo is awful. This may be mainly a Japan customs procedure, but airlines should communicate properly. Unfortunately JAL did not do this.",seats were old and worn
Japan Airlines,No vegetarian options in the Sakura lounge. When requested we have run out of options. Booked Jain meal for parents. They only have request for one sector. Tokyo to Bangalore and not for SFO to Tokyo. The rule is book 24 hours in advance. Who would book only one sector? we book business class to get personalised attention and care. The seats are good and comfortable. I might still travel JAL for my own logistics reasons of timings etc but not because I felt good with the airline.,rule is book 24 hours in advance
Japan Airlines,"At Haneda Airport, I encountered terrible ground staff. They seemed reluctant to have passengers check in at the counter insisting customers use the kiosk to print their boarding passes and baggage tags. There were staff members present, but they seemed to be in a bad mood or too tired and didn't want to help passengers with issues they were facing. I always thought that Japan Airlines' service was full of enthusiasm and proactive in assisting customers, but that was not the case.",terrible ground staff
Japan Airlines,"I am very disappointed because the airline would not allow me to book seats until check in. Then my wife and I were assigned seats that were not together. We were unable to get anyone to even try to help. Customer service pushed us off to ticketing. We showed up at 5am for our 8am flight as they instructed, only to be told to ask at the gate. We went to the gate and asked and, without even looking in the system the gate agent just told us they would not change our seats. This was NOT the Customer service l that will make me want to fly this airline again! International premium trips are too expensive to be treated poorly. What's worse is a corporate culture that doesn't encourage problem solving/customer service. For example if they cared to try do you think they could've found 2 people in regular economy who would've liked premium economy seats? Not 1 employee thought of that. I won't fly with them again.",very disappointed
Japan Airlines,"Can never say enough good comments about Japan Airlines. Customer first culture is a winner. From check-in where personalised service starts, taking us to an alternate counter so we do not need to queue, boarding and inflight service. Always attentive, even during night flights. You always get the feeling you are valued.",get the feeling you are valued
Japan Airlines,"Absolutely fantastic trip. The crew put every possible effort to welcome me onboard and to accomodate every possible desire from extra snacks to champagne. Selection of food, presentation and attention are at absolutely highest possible level. Special thanks to the team of Taguchi, Takemura, Jarupoom, Oochi for hosting me aboard and to making this flight as easy as a breeze. Thank you again",Absolutely fantastic trip
Japan Airlines,"I recently had the pleasure of flying with Japan Airlines and I have to say that it was an outstanding experience from start to finish. I booked my ticket through Delhi Office. Here one employee made the process seamless and efficient. He went extra to help me book Airport Hotel in Tokyo as well as getting my frequent flyer points credit on timely manner. Upon arriving at the airport, I was greeted by friendly staff who made the check-in process a breeze. The airport lounge was comfortable and well-equipped, with plenty of amenities to keep me occupied while I waited for my flight. Once on board, the flight crew was professional and attentive. They made sure that all passengers were comfortable and provided excellent in-flight service. The plane itself was clean and well-maintained, with comfortable seats and plenty of legroom. I was also pleasantly surprised by the quality of the Indian food and drinks offered on the flight. I am vegetarian and food was exceptionally good. Overall, I would highly recommend Japan Airlines to anyone looking for a hassle-free and enjoyable flying experience. They truly go above and beyond to ensure that their passengers have a comfortable and enjoyable journey.",an outstanding experience
Japan Airlines,"JL68 on Dec 14, 2022 - Best flight of my 4 (SEA-HAN & SGN-SEA) to Vietnam. I agree with another review that JAL serves good food ex-Tokyo, but mediocre on other routes. Very satisfied with the excellent service and comfort on this trip, and I rate this carrier just as good as other 5* carrier that I have flown recently (Asiana, EVA & Singapore).",excellent service and comfort
Japan Airlines,"The food, cabin, entertainment, and fluency were all disappointing. Food: They raved so much about the food and even made a documentary to watch as part of their entertainment selection but my food from Indonesia to US and back were all very mushy, bland, and confusing. They are kind of fusion Japanese-western but failed to capture any of those elements. For my 14 hours flight, they only served one meal and one snack, both of which were not tasty at all. Cabin: The seats were spacious but the flight was so so so warm I started sweating 10 minutes into the flight. It felt very stuffy. Entertainment: They had very limited choices of movies. Fluency: For some reason they did so many announcements, especially about their food. This kept interrupting the entertainment system. What was worse, the English announcement was very difficult to understand so it felt like they disrupt your flight and entertainment to listen to undistinguished noises.",served one meal and one snack
Japan Airlines,"I was disappointed. On the positive side the service was excellent. My food was a big disappointment,  it wasn't great and the portions were small in fact it seemed like an economy meal. The wine was limited and not what I expect from business class. The seat was okay, even though it was a 2 x 2 configuration it was quite comfortable. although I didn't know about the thin seat mattress until after the flight. The entertainment system was also limited with very few recent releases and limited selection. The headphones were rubbish I don't even think they were noise cancelling.",food was a big disappointment
Japan Airlines,"Overall, the service from dropped luggage until arrival was beyond my expectation. Dropped luggage was smooth with assistance of ground staff. The boarding was smooth, very proper announcements as zone stated in boarding pass. The cabin staff was very friendly and was service was amazing. The seat was comfortable. IFE was good. The light meal was ok as this flight are short. Wifi are good even though it is free wifi.",was beyond my expectation
Japan Airlines,JAL provided a comfortable premium economy cabin. Their product is enhanced by business lounge access at LHR and Haneda. The flight attendants were very attentive. I did not use the Wi-Fi. The food was identical to economy but was functional. The only challenge was a not great selection of inflight entertainment in my view.,comfortable premium economy
Japan Airlines,"New York to Tokyo 11th October, we decided to use some points for a simple Premium Economy flight from New York to Tokyo with Japan Airlines. Easy, points used, flights booked all good… Until we arrived at JFK airport. 3 days earlier we had tried to catch the flight but due to Covid regulations we needed a PCR test, so the flight was postponed. We then paid the additional charge to Qantas. Japan Airlines then informed us on our arrival via their supervisor our tickets were fake and we were not confirmed on the flight. Earlier that morning we had double checked with Qantas. We showed our receipt of payment, answer no. I called Qantas customer service and they tell them to look at their screen. JAL Manager says its fake and walks away. At this point the manager is trying to avoid me, I say please speak to Qantas here is the phone. They say to tell you all you have to do is look at your screen. The manager looks at the screen and our tickets were there all along. No apology.",our tickets were there all along
Japan Airlines,"I would like to share my appreciation for your ticketing agent, Tomoko. I wish I had a better photo of her or it would have been better if I had a photo with her. Tomoko was the agent who attended to me in LAX, FRI 8/5 at around 1pm Pacific Time for the JL 061 flight to Manila, Philippines. She was most efficient and demonstrated outstanding customer service. She was very genuine in ensuring that I am able to get on that flight and get back home safely to my family.  I hope this message reaches you Tomoko! You are so excellent in what you do, helping JAL customers. Thank you again for being so awesome! I would also like to commend JAL’s inflight WI-FI. I had some work to complete and was able to do so with onboard internet. Thanks again for the great end to end service! I had a great flight back home!",I had a great flight back home
Japan Airlines,"I honestly wish I could say better things about this airline, I was very disappointed. I flew Japan airlines from India to the United States with a layover in Narita. The staff was very friendly and patient. Not sure where everything broke down but both my seat and vegetarian meal requests were ignored.  The issues began with online check-in: checked into my flight online and was told to pick up my boarding pass at the airport. 8 weeks prior I requested a vegetarian meal and window seat for both legs of my flight when I was booking. During check-in, I made sure to request a vegetarian meal again which did not make it onto my boarding pass. I noticed during check in that I was assigned an aisle and middle seat for the two legs (I’d booked a window seat). Tried to request a seat change at the gate at both airports but was (very nicely at Narita I want to stress) told “the flight is full and there’s nothing we can do”. And at both airports when I requested the vegetarian meal, again “there’s nothing we can do, they’ve already loaded the food onto the flight”. Not sure what happened but I’m extremely disappointed with Japan Airlines.",seat and vegetarian meal requests were ignored
Japan Airlines,My parents and I are on vacation to attend my brother's graduation in Canada. We are now required to look for alternatives on our own because JAL cancelled our flight to Malaysia a couple of days prior to our flight due to it being an overnight transit. They are not assisting with alternatives and the only compensation they offer is a refund which is not immediate or a flight 4 months from now. I was told it was my fault for purchasing a ticket with overnight stay.  And why is cancellation notice only given through calls and at the very last minute?,refund is not immediate
Japan Airlines,"My wife and I flied JAL economy class back from Japan to Thailand early this month. The check-in was very good, The staff were very nice and efficient. We have made prior window seat booking to sit together, however, we were informed that JAl change the type of plane from B77 to B787 which is smaller, So we were not assigned to sit together by the window. Instead they assigned us to sit together in the middle row of 2-4-2 which means that we had other passengers on both side which made us very uncomfortable throughout the flight. The service is good, the food is OK.",sit together in the middle row
Japan Airlines,My wife and I choose JAL business class night flight from Bangkok to Tokyo (Haneda Airport) because we expect to have good service and some good rest. Wr found the configuration business class seat of JAL Boeing 787 is quite unexpected. The seat configuration is 2-2-2 which make the seat not so large. We can not make flat bed but rather tilted bed which make us unable to sleep. Otherwise the service was good and the food was nice. We do hope that JAL may make some change regarding business seat.,service was good and the food was nice
Japan Airlines,"I want to give every person who works for this airline a massive hug. Typically, flying economy from New York to Japan is a nightmare at around $900. This was not the case for Japan Airlines–let me count the bidets. They gave us ice cream. They asked me–nearly constantly–if I'd like something else to eat or drink. I had an entire row to myself–as did nearly everyone else on the plane. I slept, I worked. I have to say that–like everything else I know about Japan (very little) the plane exhibited a kind of antiquated futurism. Unlike most modern airplanes, it didn't have a plug for my laptop or really any movies I wanted to see. But that just meant I ended up not having to do too much work and I got to see the ending of Kenneth Branagh's Orient Express. Also, the bathroom lavatory has a heated toilet seat.",They asked me–nearly constantly–if I'd like something else to eat or drink
Japan Airlines,"This was the second time that I've flown with JAL, but the first time in almost 20 years. Service on the ground and aboard the plane was good. I ordered a specialty meal and the food was okay. For both legs of the flight, I received a total of 3.5 meals. The half-meal consisted of a small sandwich. The aircraft was only about 60 percent full during the NRT-JFK leg, so I was able to occupy all three seats on my row. That came in handy when it came time to nap, as I could lie flat across all three seats. It still wasn't as comfortable as a real bed, but it was better than sleeping sitting up. JAL's inflight entertainment offerings could use some improvement, though. Its selection wasn't as extensive as those of comparable airlines. But, given the price I paid for my ticket during the pandemic, I'd say it was good value for the money.",it was good value for the money
Japan Airlines,"For several days now I have been trying to reach JAL customer service to amend my return travel dates but have not succeeded. I called on different days and at different times. On every occasion, I was put on hold by the recorder for almost 2 hours where I was so frustrated and angry that I couldn't wait any longer. I am a Skyteam member and I chose JAL from many other carriers thinking that they are major airlines with customer service awareness and reliable after-sales support. However, It seems that I was totally wrong and disappointed. I would not recommend JAL to anyone with a flexible flying schedule as they will be disappointed as I was.",trying to reach JAL customer service
Japan Airlines,"The cabin crew were amazing, the food portions were very small for someone 6'2 but okay. The in flight entertainment was rubbish. Arrival at Haneda, had to walk miles to get to the lounge. Food in the lounge awful, drinks only open from 11 am to 8pm, and we had connected flight next morning at around 11am. Lounge closed at 11pm and 12 business class passengers had to sleep in the airport.",food portions were very small
Japan Airlines,"Seattle to Jakarta via Narita. There is some mixed feelings I have on one of the JAL Flights. The flight from Seattle to Narita in Premium Economy was a disaster while the Economy Class is somehow better than Premium Economy. The seat in Premium Economy is narrow while Economy is not that narrow. Food is the same as Economy in both classes, but good. Entertainment should be improved. WiFi is terrible and slow. My advice, if you fly JAL, maybe you should avoid their Premium Economy.",seat in Premium Economy is narrow
Japan Airlines,"Jakarta to Dallas via Tokyo. JAL is a great airline, but avoid their Premium Economy at all costs.  The seat was tight in my opinion and I barely sleep on longer flights like this. The food was disgusting. The Inflight Entertainment is pathetic - limited movies, games, live TV etc. The staff was okay and the WIFI works, but slow.",avoid their Premium Economy
Japan Airlines,"I was supposed to fly from Tokyo to Barcelona, via Paris CDG through international path (no need to get in French, EU, or Schengen territory at any point, as it was clearly stated when purchasing the flight), I had chosen precisely this airline and route, because it was one of the easiest in terms of transfer and Covid restrictions, since my final destination, Spain, had no requirement for vaccination or any type of test, and the French authorities, and CDG site stated that there were no conditions for transferring through the airport. On arrival at the checking counter at Narita airport, JAL staff asked me for my documents and my PCR test results, to what I replied, that they were not needed to get to Spain. They didn't know about the Spanish conditions and were confused from the beginning. After discussing among the team, and calling different people on the phone, they informed me that they were requiring the PCR in order to fly, because they knew of someone that got rejected to transfer in Paris without PCR. They proceeded to suggest that i changed my route to go through Helsinki and London, when I had to inform them myself, that the route was not possible since the UK was for sure requiring a PCR in order to transfer at their airports. I showed the manager the official French government and airport sites explaining that PCR was not needed for someone transferring in CDG, showed that Air France was not requiring PCR for me to fly to Spain. All these took approximately 4 hours, and the only response I got was that JAL was following indications by the Japanese embassy in France, and that on their site, they suggested that everyone had a PCR in order to transfer in France. I was offered to change my flight for the following day, under the condition of getting a PCR test. I did get my PCR test and returned to the airport the following day. Hoping that with some time, they would have had time and the decency to at least check and apologize for the mistake. Nonetheless, I found myself with the same response, that the Japanese embassy in France was suggesting a PCR, so they were right to force me to get one. This whole situation generated a very bad experience and affected my trust in JAL.",following indications by the Japanese embassy
Japan Airlines,"Please extend my respect and deep appreciation to those of your cabin crew on flight JL 8010 on 29 Sep 2021, as well as your  staff at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago who made a great effort to return my tablet to me. I left my tablet on JL 8010 when I disembarked, but did not realize it until after I had taken a shuttle bus from the international to the domestic terminal at O'Hare. When I realized my tablet was missing, I was not sure whether or not I'd left it on my international JAL plane, but since time was so limited and I could not find anyone to make a call - or help me to make a call - to the international terminal (!), I sadly resigned myself to the loss of my tablet. Imagine then how elated I was when a woman from JAL called my name at the gate where I was just preparing for the last leg of my journey on a domestic US carrier (American Airlines). She had made the effort to find me to return my tablet. I did not get her name, so cannot thank her personally, but please let her know how much the effort meant to me. I will be ever grateful to all at JAL who made the extra effort for this to happen. Thanks again for such wonderful service.",be ever grateful to all at JAL
Japan Airlines,As I am booking the flight through the 3rd party agent so there was no options for me to select on vegetarian meal. So as soon as I got in the the plane. One of the professional staff name Konuimo was listening to my concern about it and she went extra mile in arranging me the meal for the whole flight according to what I want. Although It was not inform in advance to the airline ( my fault) she still understand my concern and took care of me if I was her family member. Thumps up for her on being a very good example in today’s hospitality world. Japan Airline is on top of my list now.,Japan Airline is on top of my list
Japan Airlines,JAL customer service exceeded my expectations. My wife and 2 kids (ages 2 & 3) had a super nice experience flying with JAL. The staff and crew are very helpful and cheerful in everything they do. Food is good and the cabin is clean. Always my top option to fly to and from USA.,customer service exceeded my expectations

I'm on an economy ticket but I was treated as VIP.",Japan Airlines customer review
Japan Airlines,"This review is based on my own flying experience. I have never travelled internationally, Japan Airlines 787-8 Dreamliner Flight Number 746 was the first international flight I had. This Airline as a whole is superb. I almost forgot that we are flying thousands of feet above air because of the warm welcome and support by Japan Airlines 746 Cabin Crew on board. We are in a pandemic, but even though the cabin crew were covered with face masks it didn't hinder them in showcasing the real smiles of how we are welcomed and accommodated on board. I worked in customer service for over a decade now, and this JAL cabin crew delivered an exceptional support and service. Thank you JAL Flight 746 for your best among the rest support and service. Don't worry about your ticket, I had the lowest economy ticket but as a customer, all my expectations were overly met.",all my expectations were overly met
Japan Airlines,"Japan Airlines is the best airline I have taken so far, and it stands out because of the consistent proactive and friendly service from crew members. They were very hardworking during the flight. I saw them walking around the cabin serving drinks and snacks to passengers who did not sleep between meal services. The toilets were kept really clean throughout the flight. Further, they turned off the personal TV of passengers who have slept to avoid disturbance to other passengers due to the light. Call button was answered within seconds. I sneezed during the flight and one of the crew members immediately popped over and asked if everything was ok and if I needed a blanket or warm water. This is economy class and I can say the service standard is better than business class of many airlines.",best airline I have taken so far
Japan Airlines,"I was sent an email that said that my flight was cancelled. Apparently, my flight wasn't cancelled, and the exclusions were buried in the email under the change flight or get a refund section. I went online as suggested and requested a refund, only to be charged $300. I called the company and was told very rudely that I should have called first and that they'll have to call me back. No one called me back. I call again, and this person tells me that my flight wasn't cancelled. I said that I received an email to the contrary. Well, I send them that and was told that my flight isn't actually cancelled.  So, I say can I just rebook it or at least get a credit since I still plan on flying. I was told flat out no. So, even though they sent me a very misleading email, it was my fault, and they can't offer me anything. I didn't care about getting my money back. But a credit would have been nice since the email seemed designed to mislead others. I didn't even require the full credit, just something since what they did was horribly misleading.",they can't offer me anything
Japan Airlines,"Excellent food for an airplane choice. Excellent personnel at the airport. Excellent flight attendants, pleasant and polite which is very far from the standard of American Airlines. JAL pilot also greeted us politely too. In summary, this airline deserves a five-star review! Continue to be excellent!",this airline deserves a five-star review
Japan Airlines,"Found a great deal and flew with JAL when I traveled from southeast Texas to Singapore. JAL staff in Seattle weren't particularly friendly, but JAL staff at Narita were quite pleasant and helpful in my brief interactions with them. The quality of the meal and drinks were quite satisfactory for economy class. They had a decent selection of entertainment from around the world, including some Japanese movies that I ended up watching with English subtitles. The plane and lavatories were clean; the on-flight personnel, the utmost in being pleasant and professional. One flight attendant in particular, Cindy from Singapore, chatted with me about Singapore for a minute and wished me safe and enjoyable travels to that city. Something else: I got up and went to the toilet, and came back only to find my neck pillow missing (I'm convinced that some passenger stole it. Who does that, steal a nondescript black neck pillow?!) At any rate, I disembarked the plane after landing at Narita; right before walking out of the jetway, I still wanted to try to at least make one more effort to find that neck pillow. I explained to the flight staff that I was looking for a pillow, and it had gone missing. 5-6 flight attendants sprung into action, with me, to look for that pillow. While it was never found, I made sure to smile and say Thank you! I have a hard time imagining that that level of service would ever occur on a North American airline. The only reason that I've reduced JAL's rating from 9 to 7, is because trying to call, email or contact them otherwise through my online JAL account about changing flights is absolutely like pulling teeth (this has been a problem for a different trip than this one). JAL desperately needs to work on aspects of their off-flight customer service, at least for non-Japanese customers. Nonetheless, they're still one of the truly best airlines in the world.",one of the truly best airlines in the world

Japan Airlines,"I traveled back and forth from Paris to Tokyo with Japan Airlines and it is by far the best airline I have traveled with. I am a great traveler, since I work in tourism. I found the staff at check-in and on board, welcoming, helpful, attentive and available. The meal trays were plentiful and very good as well as the snacks between each service. Finally the space between the seats is wide, which allows the legs to unfold well, the size of the screen was also perfect. I have traveled pleasantly, I would take over this company without hesitation and for my customers too.

Les plateaux repas étaient copieux et très bons ainsi que les en-cas entre chaque prestation.

Japan Airlines,"I am so disappointed with JAL charging a cancellation fee on my ticket from Melbourne to Tokyo in this time of crisis. As Australia announced a travel ban on March 17, my family and I had to cancel our trip to Japan. Upon receiving my refund in my account however I noticed that I was short $1200. Upon contacting the JAL Australia office however, I was told that there had been a cancellation fee applied, as my refund was processed 1 day before their policy update.",processed 1 day before their policy update
Japan Airlines,"Tokyo Narita to Singapore. Arrived at Narita at 5:30pm to check in my luggage. Couldn’t find the business check-in and the JAL ground crew could see I was in distress from missing the flight. Pulled to her counter and helped me out along the way. Checked me in Super efficiently (less than 5 minutes) and got another ground staff to rush me to the get. Thanks to the checkin staff and the ground staff who ran me to my gate so calmly. Could see Imei (the ground crew) tried to calm me down while rushing to my gate. Excellent service. From both ground crew, will definitely fly Japan Airlines again.",definitely fly Japan Airlines again
Japan Airlines,"I booked a premium economy ticket with Japan Airlines from Paris to Sydney. My flight leaving Paris with Finnair was delayed. There was only an hour between connecting flights so I missed my connecting flight from Helsinki to Tokyo. Upon arriving in Helsinki I was met by someone from Finnair who said they were putting me on a Finnair flight. I asked them what what class I was being put in as my ticket was premium economy and I knew Finnair didn't offer premium economy. They told me it was economy and that there was nothing they could do. I queried this with several people before I boarded the plane which didn't seem to go down well with anybody. I was told I was holding the plane up, to get on the plane and to contact customer service when I landed. I did get on the plane and endured 9 hours of a cramped seat. I contacted Japan Airlines when I got back to complain about this and to ask for a refund for this part of my flight. Japan Airlines have told me it is not their problem and I have to contact Finnair. I asked several questions in my letter - who decided I was being put on a Finnair flight, was Japan Airlines given the option of waiting for my flight, why wasn't I asked if I wanted to fly the next day on a Japan Airlines flight. None of these questions have been answered. I am slightly confused why I would be writing to an airline that I have not paid for a ticket to ask for a refund - ie Finnair. My tickets were booked through Japan Airlines so surely it is their responsibility to deal with issues/complaints from their tickets holders. I have written to Japan Airlines three times and got the same response each time, with one response finishing with I do hope you will fly Japan Airlines again. My flight from Sydney to Paris which was actually with Japan Airlines went without a fault. They have a fantastic premium economy product. Plenty of space and legroom. Even though the food served is the same as in economy it was some of the best airline food I have tasted and the service was fantastic too. I actually thought I had found a really good value for money alternative to business class. I am aware things can go wrong and sometimes missing connecting flights is out of anyone's control. However the way my complaint has been handled left me astounded. There has been zero care factor or empathy.",putting me on a Finnair flight
Japan Airlines,"Tokyo to Vancouver. They turned the plane around halfway to Vancouver for what they said was an injury, which didn't make any sense because if it was an emergency we could have landed in Hawaii as opposed to flying four hours back the way we came. They gave us no information, flew us to a different airport than we started in, refused to get us a hotel, and it took 12 hours for the flight to leave again, and we weren't allowed to leave the gate because it was too complicated. They refused compensation or tell us how to file a complaint. Service was horrible, little to no information, and they were still two hours late taking off on the recovery flight with us stuck in our seats on the tarmac that whole time, then it took nearly two hours to get our baggage in Vancouver. Once in Canada, a supervisor refused to tell me how I could file a claim or complaint, which is illegal. They did try to force me to accept a gift card and sign a piece of paper in Japanese, which I refused.",gave us no information
Japan Airlines,"Melbourne to Tokyo. Did not get off to a good start when Business check in was cluttered with Economy passengers, then ushered to Economy desk. Lounge was an insult to business class passengers. On board, the seat while comfortable, had no storage (window), aisles had some. First business class flight I have flown where a welcome drink was not offered. Amenity kit had no socks. I did not eat on the aircraft, but the flight crew were attentive and polite. I doubt I would choose this airline again for business class travel, which is a shame as I had previously flown Premium Economy and found them brilliant.",seat had no storage
Japan Airlines,"Shanghai to San Diego via Tokyo. This just might be the best economy class experiences I've had up to this point. The food was amazing - extremely delicate and exquisite. The flow of the service was great and the crew's interaction between passengers was natural and polite. Though flying in economy, I can see JAL incorporates some unique elements into the flight (such as beverages, magazines, and movies). Japan Airlines is the only airline worldwide offering a 2-4-2 config for B787. The pitch and legroom were way beyond satisfactory. Ground services were efficient in both Pudong and Narita and each boarding group was lined separately. Won't hesitate to fly with JAL in the future.",best economy class experiences
Japan Airlines,"Tokyo to Kuala Lumpur. This was a code share from Malaysian Airlines and there was some e-ticket number missing in one of the the 3 passenger details. The lady and her superior at check in was quite inefficient at solving the problem we had with our ticket. We were told to call Malaysia Airlines, how can JAL treat us like that. I asked the staff at check in if she could speak to my travel agent in India but she said only if the travel agent speaks in Japanese.",e-ticket number missing
Japan Airlines,"Jakarta to Chicago via Tokyo. My first time with JAL is not a disappointment. The seat space is spacious and the seat is wide enough, making me comfortable sleeping during long haul flight, from Tokyo Narita to Chicago. One thing that I also love is the food quality! It is like eating in a restaurant with stars.  In my opinion, JAL's food is the best. I would definitely fly with JAL again.",JAL is not a disappointment
Japan Airlines,"Manila to Boston via Tokyo-Narita. The flight from Manila to Tokyo was operated on a B787-8, and the flight from Tokyo to Boston was operated on a B787-9. The infamously horrible traffic in Manila made me arrive at the airport only 57 minutes prior to my departure time. I panicked! Upon arrival at check-in, though, a lady at the business class check-in desk checked me in and assured me that I would make my flight. Indeed, because Japan Airlines boarded the aircraft beginning only 30 minutes before departure and did not close the gate until 10 minutes before departure, things went just fine. I know that many airlines would not be so forgiving of a late arrival. Many airlines also would probably have lost my luggage when I checked it in so late. Not Japan Airlines! It made it all the way to Boston. As for the inflight experience, the flight attendants were polite, friendly, and accommodating. I was seated in a bulkhead seat for the first time in many years, and one of the flight attendants helped me to open up the TV monitor for that seat. The seats were very comfortable. Blankets and pillows were available on both flights. Toothbrushes and toothpaste were available in the lavatories during the flight from Tokyo to Boston. Too bad that there were no amenity kits, but it's always the toothbrushes and toothpaste that I most desire during such flights, so they just barely met my expectations there. Perhaps the least impressive part of the experience was the inflight entertainment. While I appreciated that they offered manga for people to read if they so desired, the selection of movies and TV seemed somewhat lackluster, and it was disappointing that many items were not available with English subtitles. Finally, there was the food. I was served one full meal on the flight from Manila to Tokyo and one full meal and a sort of light meal on the flight from Tokyo to Boston. We were also served packaged snacks about 35 minutes prior to landing in Boston, which seemed kind of last-minute to me and a little awkward. The full meals were truly enormous-by far the largest meals I have ever had on a flight. The one served from Manila to Tokyo was perhaps the largest of all. The entree was a sort of chicken in a creamy mushroom sauce, served with sliced carrots, sliced zucchini, and fried rice with egg and vegetables. It also came with a vegetable salad with dressing, a fruit salad, a noodle salad, a potato salad with ham and cheese, miso soup, Haagen-Daaz vanilla ice cream, a chocolate chip cookie, a bottle of water, and your choice of beverage. I found it particularly stunning that Japan Airlines has their own kiwi-apple juice blend which they call Sky Time Kiwi. Wow! All of the foods I was served were delicious. One criticism I can make of the food is that with the exception of the full meal from Tokyo to Boston, there was no choice for the meal options. That is, you got what you were served. Overall, though, it was a truly Japanese experience, and it was truly excellent. I would gladly fly with them again in the future if they offer tickets at competitive prices like they did this time.","polite, friendly, and accommodating"
Japan Airlines,"Boston to Manila via Tokyo-Narita. The flight from Boston to Tokyo was on a B787-9, and the flight from Tokyo to Manila was on a B787-8. The flight from Boston to Tokyo was scheduled to depart in the middle of a blizzard. Unfortunately, this created some problems regarding preparing the aircraft. We eventually boarded (very quickly, as is Japan Airlines' custom). We then had to wait for a while as our plane was de-iced. We ended up leaving Boston about two hours late. However, the pilots were able to make up for one of those hours in the air, so that we only arrived about one hour late in Tokyo. Another passenger was concerned about making his connecting flight in Tokyo. A flight attendant calmly explained that he would have enough time and that they would hold the flight for him if necessary. This turned out to be unnecessary, as, to my shock, the staff at Narita basically just allowed all arriving passengers with connecting international flights to go directly into the gate area without first clearing security. This was truly a godsend and ensured that people really did make their connecting flights. And since gates weren't supposed to close until just 10 minutes before departure, this meant they did not even have to hold planes for people! As for the inflight experience, it was similar to my experiences from Manila to Boston, except that there was no last-minute snack service just before arriving in Tokyo. Instead, they offered us sweet buns midway through the flight. Again, we were served a full meal on the flight from Boston to Tokyo and on the flight from Tokyo to Manila, as well as a light meal towards the end of the flight from Boston to Tokyo. And once again, with the exception of the full meal from Boston to Tokyo, there were no choices for the meals-there was only one option. However, as usual, all of the food was truly superb. Because I was flying during a different month from my previous flights with Japan Airlines, I noticed they removed from their entertainment system a movie I had begun watching previously and had hoped to finish watching during this trip. That was disappointing. There were toothbrushes and toothpaste available in the lavatories during the flight from Boston to Tokyo, but not until relatively late in the flight. Again, flight attendants and gate staff were fantastic. Another excellent experience on Japan Airlines!",all of the food was truly superb
Japan Airlines,"Tokyo to London Heathrow. One of the best airlines I've flown with. Clean aircraft, very good food and cabin crew at your service, making sure you are comfortable and don’t need anything. And I was in Eco class. I had the chance to chat with the crew during the flight, attitude free, very simple, but sharply professional. The inflight entertainment can be improved but the essentials were there. The flight was slightly delayed but the crew on the ground kept constatant communication and we ended up landed early. I will definitely fly again with JAL.",One of the best airlines I've flown with
Japan Airlines,"Tokyo Narita to Busan. This return flight in October gave me great impressions and respect for Japan Airlines. The highlight was the presentation and quality of the meal. The Busan bound flight had a beautiful bento box presented like a gift! Food inside was the yummiest airplane food I've ever tasted! In both flights, I had the luck of sitting on exit row seat. However, the width of the seat gave a cramped feeling. The aircon didn't work well. Interior tapestry was worn and old. The service and politeness from the flight attendants was amazing though. The Tokyo bound flight was delayed by 5 hours due to typhoon. The JAL staff at Busan airport worked so hard with good organization skills to keep every passenger informed, providing extra support, and apologizing at times with bows, even after arrival in Tokyo. This and many other factors - no wonder JAL is a 5-star airline!",great impressions and respect
Japan Airlines,"Chicago to Tokyo Narita. Had a great experience with JAL. Legroom was generous. Seats were well designed. Food was tasty and plentiful. Staff were very helpful and pleasant to deal with. When we almost missed the cutoff time for checked baggage, we received help from a supervisor to get our bags checked in by her personally. JAL made my partner's first trans-Pacific flight an easy experience. My only criticism is that the selection of English movies wasn't very recent.",Had a great experience
Japan Airlines,Tokyo to Singapore. The cabin was very warm and stuffy and no improvement was made after feedback to cabin crews. The cabin crews imposed a liquor ban on me when I only drank 6 cans of beer. I was neither drunk or behaving disorderly to warrant such a ban. I have flown in many airlines and this was the first time that I was humiliated with a liquor ban.,imposed a liquor ban on me
Japan Airlines,"Tokyo to Melbourne. On the good side, excellent seat, lies properly flat and gives great privacy for business class. Big screen tv and the supplied mattress topper is a nice touch, so comfortable. The on board wifi is awful, very slow and drops out, on the way up I couldn’t get it to connect at all but I was charged twice, on the way home there have been service issues. I ordered a meal, 45 mins later I didn’t have it, I had to go forward and ask again, they apologised then it came, twice. When finished I waited for the tray to be collected, as that didn’t happen I pressed the call bell, no one came.  It’s a pity about the service, good seat, nice clean plane just service that’s not good enough for business class prices.",on board wifi is awful
Japan Airlines,"Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo Narita. I flew economy outbound and premium economy on the return. The hard product in either cabin is right up there with the very best. pEconomy seat was spacious with generous knee and shoulder room (8-across on the 787,), the premium economy seat was a hard-shell so you could recline without seeking the blessing of the pax behind. In both cases I liked the attention to storage of smaller items (mini seat pockets etc.) Soft product is not far behind. Catering is good, with flavourful and balanced menus. In particular, the premium economy lunch featured winning entries from a public competition JAL ran, where the side dishes (3) were truly outstanding. Will be dreaming about the sesame tofu for a long time yet. Brownie points for serving hot miso soup at 38,000 feet. I also appreciated the extensive drinks menu featuring shochu, umeshu, and sake. You pay a slight premium for JAL, but it's totally worth it!",it's totally worth it
Japan Airlines,Flew from Osaka to Los Angeles on 9/9/2019 at 5:25 PM boarding time. The gate agents were very helpful and friendly. I’ve never receive such great service from an international airline ever! I highly recommend Japanese Airlines and would recommend this airline to any friends or relatives.,highly recommend Japanese Airlines
Japan Airlines,"Los Angeles to Osaka. One of the best flights. The Boeing 777 8 seat rows provide additional side space; legroom was also large. Smooth boarding, flight attendants were very attentive, smiling and helpful. Meals were good, good selection of movies and ok for music (but very subjective). Small details that make a difference: good food, toothbrush available, snacks and drinks between meals, space.",One of the best flights
Japan Airlines,"Frankfurt to Narita. I was impressed by JAL's product: Crew: Perfect overall. Food was served in a timely manner, with a genuine smile. Very knowledgeable about the product, can answer any question (I was impressed how a first timer in Business Class could answer about almost everything). Food is a difficult topic as some may not like Japanese food and be more satisfied with a nice piece of meat. But in terms of Japanese Cuisine, what JAL offers in business class is excellent. Rare food such as Awabi (Abalone) was even offered. I never took the western menu so I cannot comment on that. The Skysuite product is wonderful, especially on the window side. Thinking this product was introduced in 2013, it is still among the best seat on the market. Window seat offers complete privacy. All seats offer a fully flat bed which does not become narrow at your feet, and a very comfortable mattress and pillow. ANA is just catching up this year with their new product. I prefer this setup compared to the widely used reverse herringbone layout. Plane: The Boeing 787 is a great plane, although I prefer the A350 (the A350 is I think quieter). Boarding and on ground experience: JAL offers to wrap your luggage for free if you wish, which is not the case of all airlines. Check in is efficient, as well as boarding. Lounge looks good but I never drink or eat anything as I prefer to relax with a glass of water and look forward to the flight.",absolutely wonderful
Japan Airlines,"Osaka to Los Angeles. JAL has high quality service, and on the Boeing 777 has only 8 seats per row rather than 9 in economy class, providing additional width space. Legroom was spacious on this flight. All in all a great flight, save the delay (bit less than 1h) and the choice of movies.",Legroom was spacious
Japan Airlines,"Japan Airlines business class is basically a fraud. Flying Tokyo to Sapporo business class. Seats slightly better than coach but we are still squeezed in a central row of four like sardines. No lounge access, no priority boarding, no welcome drinks, nobody would hang your jacket. There is a real business class, called first class. The pseudo business class is what, at best, other airlines call economy plus.",squeezed in a central row of four
Japan Airlines,"It is a short distance from Tokyo to Seoul (2 hours). Nevertheless, this airline flies an aircraft with full-flat, all-isle business-class seats for this route, which I liked very much. they have spacious lounge with a choice of drinks in Haneda, and flight attendants were courteous. On return at Gimpo airport, the Korean lounge was small and overcrowded. The only thing they should do is to warn business-class passengers not to slam shut their tables, because this annoys their front passengers severely.",flight attendants were courteous
Japan Airlines,"Akita to Sapporo. This flight was operated by J-Air. A fast and friendly check-in was followed by an effortless, punctual and enjoyable flight. The cabin crew were friendly, although there was no onboard service on this flight (possibly due to turbulence). Baggage arrived quickly (all thoughtfully placed on the carousel with the handles facing out). I was on a train into town within 25 minutes of touch-down.",cabin crew were friendly
Japan Airlines,"Osaka Itami to Sapporo. Check-in was remarkably quick and friendly. There were few passengers at the airport, possibly due to the G20 summit in Osaka at the time. Boarding was smooth, and the cabin crew were friendly and efficient. The plane was spotlessly clean and the seats spacious enough for a 90-minute flight. No food was served,  only a soft drink or hot drink. The plane was perfectly on time.",the seats spacious enough
Japan Airlines,"San Francisco to Tokyo Haneda. Best airline I have ever flown. Economy class seats have enough of space to stretch your legs - im 5'11, food is on business class level when compared to any US or European based carriers. 2 checked baggage pieces standard, its employees don't panhandle for extra fees. Remember all the glamour of the airline travelling from 30 years ago? It still lives on with JAL!",Best airline I have ever flown
Japan Airlines,"Seattle to Tokyo . We purchased an air ticket for my wife to travel to visit family in Tokyo, Japan, on JAL. The ticket was purchased via GoToGate travel - purchased on 4/3/2019 for travel beginning on 6/25/2019 at a cost of approximately $1200. Unfortunately, after booking and upon inspection of her travel document, she discovered a typographical error in her first name. On the ticket, her first name (four letters) has an extra letter (ii instead of i) rather than the correct spelling. We're not sure how this happened, and were quite surprised to see it. We made repeated attempts to rectify this situation and get the typo corrected. We contacted GoToGate by phone and email multiple times. We contacted JAL by phone and email multiple times. We drove to the airport in San Diego and asked for help at the JAL desk. We contacted Alaska Air. Though our efforts did receive some replies, none were satisfactory. The typo remains on the ticket. Given the fact that TSA or the Airline may stop her at Airport Security Screening, or stop her from boarding the flight, she is not willing to use the ticket. Therefore, we have requested a full refund for the amount of the ticket, minus an appropriate handling fee, so that her booking via Go To Gate on Alaska and JAL will available, and so that some other passenger may book travel on the seat. We believe that the airline and the travel agency have a moral obligation and responsibility to serve customers to the best of their abilities, and to rectify this kind of situation. Moreover, both the airline, the travel agency, and other customers stand to benefit by allowing the seat to be used by another customer. We are aware of the airline policies and practices regarding refunds and changes, yet we believe certain situations are exceptional and require flexibility. At this point, all we can do is chalk it up to corporate greed and feel a simmering anger over our loss.",requested a full refund
Japan Airlines,"My first flight was from Vancouver to Tokyo and I was so disappointed in the business class not having full lay flat seats and having to step over the passenger beside me every time I had to go to the washroom. The service was mediocre at best. I felt like it was premium economy. What saved Japan airlines for me was the flight from Tokyo to Delhi. It was like night and day. The seats are 1-2-1 configuration so you have a lot of privacy. The seats had lots of storage space and the tv was huge. The flight attendants were incredible, always walking by to see if we needed anything and the bathroom was clean. I don't know why there was such a big difference in the flights. But Japan Airlines is now my second favorite after EVA Air. But beware as some planes are still the old horrible configuration.",attendants were incredible
Japan Airlines,"Los Angeles to Jakarta via Tokyo. The cabin crew was so friendly and polite. They smile from the heart. The food was terrific, it was amazing. I will use this airline again.",food was terrific
Japan Airlines,"Los Angeles to Ho Chi Minh City via Tokyo. I was very frustrated of how JAL treats its customer in my latest flight. My flight was through 02 transits each for the arrival and return trip, and most of the flights which were run in cooperation between JAL and American Airlines had at least 30 min delay but I was fine about that. However, in my second flight upon return after the first transit, JAL was late for 1 hour and 20 mins due to maintenance issue, whilst my connecting flight (the final one to return home) is only 1 hour from the previous flight's arrival time. When we got to NRT, the connecting flight has not yet departed, and was still boarding, but instead of guiding us to the gate so that we can be on board quickly (which may take approx. 10 mins), they threw us to another airline, with an additional transit (KL) and additional 10 hours flight and waiting at the KL airport. What is even more frustrating is the JAL staff who gave us the new ticket, she said in the first place when we just arrived, running and confused: JAL arranged another flight by which we can get home at midnight on the same day ?. Only when we recheck our tickets it appears that we have to wait 5 hours at KL and arrive at 10:00AM the next day. (The group that were left from the final flight was about 6 people). When we asked about our luggage, she said that our luggage is already transferred to the final destination and we don't have to worry about them  - should we not worry if the luggage arrive before us? Later, I checked with another girl at the counter, she said that our luggage are coming with us on this flight, and it is the airlines rule that the luggage must fly together with the passenger. Everything happened today was such a disappointment and created a bad impression to me about JAL. We waited for them to be late for 01 hr and 20 min, whilst they cannot wait for us just a few minutes so we can get to the gate and come home after 14 flight hours, just to be on time on THAT flight, as if they are very punctual and never delay.. One of the guy left in the group said that he had a flight with JAL before and the same issue happened. I will never use your service again!",such a disappointment
Japan Airlines,"Singapore Changi to Tokyo Narita. The best thing about Japan Airlines was that, among other airlines I had flown with, they had the most polite and courteous cabin crew. In other areas, there was not much to pick on either. The seat was quite comfortable with a rather generous amount of leg space (I am 176cm tall). The movies available were quite up-to-date too. The only downside, if I must mention any, was that I was not given the option of choosing my seat.",the most polite and courteous cabin crew
Japan Airlines,"Japan Airlines offers 2 nonstop flights from New York JFK to Tokyo, and this is the later one to the more central Haneda airport. The airline is one of the 4 main operators at JFK Terminal One, but it is the only of the 4 that does not have its own lounge at JFK. They offer their premium passengers access to Lufthansa's Senator Lounge instead. Boarding was quite nice and in order, something that I have not seen in Terminal One for a long time. The F Sky Suite was nicely designed and spacious, with ample storage space. Meals were good and nicely presented, as expected from a leading F product. Staff are respectful and accommodating. I picked the Japanese menu but also expressed that I liked caviar, which belonged to the Western menu, and the attendant happily obliged. She also offered to make my bed in the suite across the aisle (the cabin was only half full) so I can continue to use my suite for lounging and the other for sleeping. Such small initiatives made a difference between good and excellent service. It should be noted that, unlike many other first class suites, the Sky Suite does not have a personal closet to hang your clothes. After I changed and exited the WC, an attendant already waited outside with a hanger offering to hang my clothes for me. What a valet service. Overall, I think Japan Airlines First Class product deserves it 5-star status.",deserves it 5-star status
Japan Airlines,"Lots to like about this flight but are few negative points. The good: Great value as purchased 9 months in advance and travel was at Easter, excellent check-in, lounge given OW Status, boarding was efficient and on time departure. Midnight departure so snack bag and water given less than 10 mins after seat belt sign off letting everyone get to sleep. Minimal announcements and big breakfast served 2.5 hours before arrival. Leg room great, toilets always clean, staff very attentive. The Improvements: Seat base is thin and while leg room great I found the seat thin and uncomfortable, Toilets, 3 shared amongst 150 economy and Premium economy pax, so while clean there was always a line. Movie range was a bit limited, great system but minimal new movies. Overall still a great way to get to Japan from Melbourne, leave at midnight and arrive at 9am, no time lost. WiFi while active was never strong enough to do anything.",staff very attentive
Japan Airlines,"Seattle to Tokyo Narita. Not a good experience. Cabin crew were fantastic and graceful but the seat - one of the newer lay flat suites was clostrophobic with the divider up. Hate the Boeing 787 electronic window blinds because they do not get completely dark - on a flight heading west, they do not stop the sun shining into the cabin and heating it up. IFE was OK but not outstanding. Although the crew were great, the food (Japanese set ) was not fresh. The drink service was slow as well which for a flight that is not too long delayed food service and resulted in little time for sleep. Lounge in Seattle was really poor (The Club) and not up to biz class standards. Sakura lounge in NRT was not much better. All in all will not fly JAL again to Asia from West Coast.",Not a good experience
Japan Airlines,"Tokyo to Taipei. First the flight was delayed at the gate after boarding for more than 45 minutes, taxi for another 30 minutes. So the plane was late leaving and late arriving in Taiwan. The food was so so, for business class, really it could have been better. Gate staff also were not well organized. It is surprising for Japan. The lack of signs at the airport gate area and the size of the gate area were terrible. Passengers did not know which lines to go to and business and first class passengers also had to fight through the crowd to board. The biggest problem with the flight was a screaming infant across the isle. Flight attendants did nothing. The parents and grandparents also did nothing. It was horrifying. People should not be traveling with infants, period, for any reason unless they are moving abroad! These were typical selfish parents who insist to travel with their family and could careless about other people. The flight was full and their kid was crying the whole time. Which means their kid was not comfortable. This selfishness has to stop, and airline staff and airlines need to address it instead of ignoring it. I paid good money for a business class seat, and yet I had to endure this nonsense the entire flight. I am sympathetic in most cases where a kid may act out for a short period of time, but this was ridiculous.",a screaming infant
Japan Airlines,"Vancouver to Bangkok via Tokyo 2 weeks ago. First sign of trouble began when we started circling Narita and crew warned us there would be a delay in landing. This made me nervous as my connecting flight to Bangkok was in 1.5 hours. We circled for nearly an hour before the captain came on the intercom and said we were being redirected to Haneda Airport. No reason given, only apology for inconvenience. We landed and refueled, waited another 1.5 hours and took off again, landing at Narita 45 minutes later. No explanation given, just sorry for inconvenience. I ran into the airport, hoping that my connecting flight had waited for me, but it was to no avail. My connecting flight had already left. I had to wait in another line for 2.5 hours to get booked on the first morning flight to BKK, and JAL put me up in a Narita Hotel. I found out that the delay was caused because an earlier aircraft had run off the runway, causing the airport delay. Anyway, bad enough, get on with life. A week later I show up at the airport in Bangkok, and JAL ticket counter informs me my flight has been delayed by 3 hours. Oh hell, not again! Which of course means I cannot catch my connecting flight in Narita again. I ask the reason for the delay, they tell me it's maintenance issue. Wait for over an hour, and to JAL's credit they do book me a flight on EVA air in business class. Thumbs up for that. But to have 2 major flight delays by the same airline on same itinerary is pretty sad.",2 major flight delays
Japan Airlines,"Jakarta to Vancouver via Narita. My wife and I flew this routing. The seats on plane (both segments on Boeing 787) from Jakarta to Narita we’re far superior than seat from Narita to Vancouver. Cabin staff on both legs were all very friendly, very professional and deserve high marks. The inflight entertainment options were somewhat limited compared to other carriers. Headsets also not as comfortable as others (small headphones). The food was very good as was beverage selection. We’d both recommend JAL business class.",recommend JAL business class
Japan Airlines,"Lounge access with JAL premium economy experience is fab. 9am Sydney-Tokyo and Sydney Qantas Business lounge was excellent - barrister coffee and all cold and hot breakfast food was fresh . Boarding no hassles, FA's warm and friendly. Premium economy seats are best in class, loads of leg room and hard shell recliner, so no one leaning into you. FA's all smiles and each leg gave consistent, professional service, best experience I've had on that level. IFE so so, but enough to keep me going. Great drinks selection, including champagne - FA's happily kept it flowing. Food wasn't too bad, and loads of snacks like noodle pots. Transit in Tokyo, Narita to Haneda by Bus took only 80 minutes. Haneda lounge not too bad, could be better. Tokyo-/London flight solid repeat performance. Great airline, will fly again.","Great airline, will fly again"
Japan Airlines,Tokyo Narita to Melbourne. The check in was easy. We were in the economy class and the seat was comfortable enough for 10 hours flight. The lavatory was quite big. The food/dinner was good too but for the second meal wasn’t that nice/fulfilling. It was a 10 hours flight so the airline should consider giving sufficient meal for the passengers. The customer service was friendly.,seat was comfortable enough
Japan Airlines,Beijing to Tokyo. Very helpful land and cabin service. Food is comparatively good in the economy class. The aircraft isn’t the newest 787-9 but still feel good and comfortable. Overall satisfied like other Japanese flights.,good and comfortable
Japan Airlines,"Ho Chi Minh City to Tokyo. I had the worst experience ever after years of flying. First there was a one hour delay (JL070), we was disgrunted but let it go. Then after we settled in the aircraft for an hour without moving anywhere, they finally announced that the engine broke and will take 1 hour to fix. I am currently writing this review at 4:40 am (flight was supposed to depart at 23:35) and there is still no sign that the plane actually move. Greatly disappointed with the professionalism of this airline, do not blame on technical issues given that this could be prevented from their end. No compensation was given, not even a formal apology",Greatly disappointed
Japan Airlines,Okinawa to Tokyo. My daughter and I just took a mini vacation to Tokyo  we flew on Japan airlines. After we arrived in Tokyo my daughter was informed that her dog was in the hospital and very sick. She tried with many different employees of Japan Airlines to change our flights to fly back earlier but they refused because she bought the tickets from Expedia. Well these two customers will never fly Japan Airlines again.,never fly Japan Airlines again
Japan Airlines,Helsinki to Tokyo Narita. It is 10 years since I flew JAL and I was very impressed with the improvement. Charming ground staff in Helsinki and the crew have their mojo back and were faultless despite a full flight. The meal was good and it was nice to get flavoured steamed spinach as the salad instead of the standard offering. My only negative would be the IFE choice. The cabin temperature was perfect despite usual all comments about heat.,impressed with the improvement
Japan Airlines,"Melbourne to Osaka via Tokyo, transferring from Narita to Haneda in Tokyo. Overall this was quite a disappointing experience, considering how much more expensive JAL is on this route than other carriers with a single stop. On all legs the cabin crew were great - very welcoming, responsive to requests and eager to please. All flights operated on time. The seating was fine, though there is very little storage space in the B787 business class seat. In Melbourne JAL uses the Marhaba lounge, which is OK but offers no hot vegetarian food options. At Haneda airport the JAL Sakura lounge has great views of the runway, but food and drink choices were very limited (tea, coffee, soft drinks and rice crackers only). No welcome drink prior to take-off was offered on any sector, but after take-off the cabin crew were very efficient in meeting any requests. Unfortunately the vegetarian meals were never Japanese, and ranged from bland to unpleasant (I'm thinking of a certain vegetarian hamburger). On board the domestic flight from Haneda to Osaka Kansai the seat was very comfortable and the service was excellent - but only tea, coffee and soft drinks (no snack) were served. JAL does not help business class passengers or provide tickets for the transfer between Narita and Haneda airports in Tokyo. You have to make your own way. I enquired on check-in in Melbourne about that, and was just told vaguely that there is a bus. It feels like there is a great airline in there struggling to get out, but held back by obvious penny-pinching.",a disappointing experience
Japan Airlines,"Sydney to Tokyo Narita. Sadly disappointed by Japan Airlines. While the crews and seating were superb the meals in premium economy (and economy) were just plain awful.  I like Japanese food very much but, except for the Udon-in-the-Sky snack, the meals, especially on the Sydney to Narita leg were disgusting. Economy meals on Japan Airlines used to be some of the industry's best - these were some of the worst. I'd be happy to pay an extra $100 or more to get a decent set of meals instead of the awful food served on this route. On the other hand, its fair to say the cabin crew were superb, intelligent, and efficient in every way, the flights were on-time and the aircraft absolutely spotless, Its great that JAL uses the Qantas Lounge in Sydney and this is better than the JAL First Class Lounge at Narita, where the food has gone downhill. Also a lot of the staff in there are very officious and made me want to get out as soon as I could.",meals were just plain awful
Japan Airlines,"This is my first time using Japan Airline, I flew from Bangkok to Tokyo, flight# 708, and from Tokyo to Los Angeles, flight# 62, on October 27, 2018. I would like to thank the flight attendants who were extremely caring, the took care of me. Thank you very much and keep up the good work.",attendants extremely caring
Japan Airlines,"I was excited flying JAL longhaul for the first time. Checkin and fast lane Security Check took just 5 minutes. I had access to the JAL First class lounge due to my One World Platinum status. The lounge was very crowded and noisy on this Sunday morning. I was looking for a nice breakfast, but just some Croissants and muffins were on offer. The Sushi counter is great, but not at 9 am, overall, the JAL first lounge was rather dissapointing. This impression continued for the flight itself. The B789 had the so called Sky Suites III installed, which do not come even close to Qatar’s Qsuite, which I had the pleasure to fly last week. They are very narrow and uncomfortable. The service was ok, but nothing special. The Japanese choice of food was good, but not really wow. Overall, a rather average experience. I expected a lot more from JAL. This wasn’t 5 Star.","service was ok, but nothing special"
Japan Airlines,"Tokyo Haneda to Bangkok. Ground services again slightly underwhelming, with limited food choices at Sakura Lounge. No priority security check permitted, despite travelling Business .Boarding bizarre to say the least, with 80% of passengers boarding through Business Class gate by dint of their airline membership status, not their class of travel. In flight service much better on this return leg, with prompt drink and food service, and infinitely better quality of food. Seat discomfort still a big issue, with the coffin style design, limited flexibility, maneuverability etc. Staff extremely attentive and polite.",In flight service much better
Japan Airlines,"Bangkok to Tokyo Haneda. Outbound from BKK to HND has a different quality to the inbound. First off, lounge facilities in BKK are not very inspired, with poor food choices - including curry rice at 8 am and its accompanying smell. Boarding at the gate is by one queue for all class of passengers. In flight service takes 1 hour for a drink to be served and meal service 1 hr 20 mins. Food quality very different to that presented from Tokyo. Staff always very polite and pleasant. Seat is not comfortable with limited options. AVOD not fully functioning. No priority arrival facility at HND. 5* rating for JAL seems overrated.",JAL seems overrated
Japan Airlines,"San Diego to Bangkok via Tokyo. I love JAL, they are my go to choice over the Pacific.  I purchased a not-particularly discounted one way ticket on JAL through Expedia. I didn't realize that advance seat selection wasn't possible on this class of service, and Expedia didn't mention it. Here's where I became quite disappointed. I'm elite on a partner airline with JAL. When seats are assigned, generally elites get processed first--window or aisle. Not only did I get middle seats, I was inexplicably given a middle seat in the very last row on my second segment, on a flight that had many empty rows. That's not only odd, it's vindictive. Someone (or some software) went out of its way to put me in a middle seat in the last row when there were dozens of better seats available. When I arrived at the airport, I was able to get the connecting flight adjusted, but the trans-Pacific segment was full, with no remaining aisle or window seats, and no upgrades available for purchase. The ticket agent offered to put my name on a list to move me to a new seat. Here's where JAL won me back. I presumed that this list functioned in the same way it would with US carriers, it got me to shut up and go away, but no one actually pays attention to it. That's where I was wrong. Within 15 minutes I had been moved to a window seat. Now, the rest of the trip was standard JAL. Massive amounts of pretty good food and wine. Fast service with a smile. On time departures and arrivals. Clean aircraft. Let's not forget to mention that JAL only put 8 seats across on its 787s, compared to the 9 that most of their competitors have. More room, more breathable air, and more overhead space. The seats were comfy and had a surprising amount of recline - like feel guilty for going back this far recline. The entertainment came up a bit short for 17 hours in the air, and curses on the person who offers up 75% of a bingeworthy season of a tv show and leaves us hanging. Narita is weirdly depressing and in desperate need of a facelift, but that was a 90 minute connection and certainly not a reason to avoid JAL. JAL is deserving of the 5 star ranking they've been given.",my choice over the Pacific
Japan Airlines,"Tokyo to Honolulu. I usually fly premium economy or business, if I'm lucky. I was terribly worried about this flight to and from Hawaii in the normal economy, but I was pleasantly surprised! They FA's were extremely cheerful and hard-working. The catering was adequate and delicious. The cabin kept very clean, including the toilets. The star of the show is the seats. My goodness, I'm a big person (183 cm tall and 230 kg), and even I was comfortable! I couldn't believe the legroom and the seat width of these wider seats. They are premium economy standard on many US airlines but extended to the entire economy class. On the downside, JAL is notorious for keeping the planes warm since Japanese are adverse to air conditioning and even air passing over their skin. I always take a fan to keep cool. Also, the AVOD is lacking. This is the one area they simply must improve upon. Oh, they offer wifi onboard, but it didn't work for me or my partner. It never prompted with a pay screen and it was not free.",I was pleasantly surprised
Japan Airlines,"Booked as BA codeshare, but BA couldn't access JL to confirm a seat, so ended up in the middle NRT/HEL (19E). Actually worked OK because legroom and recline is so good. On time departure and arrival. This time DBML selections weren't as good for a diabetic, but crew intervened to provide food from C cabin to compensate - bravo! Service excellent again. 1 hr 15m transfer at HEL but no hold luggage and super efficient process, so made it fine. AY to LHR on A321 was unmemorable, but did have 8C, which is an extra legroom seat. Again, even with the connection I'd choose this over BA any day.",Service excellent again
Japan Airlines,"Delhi to Dallas via Tokyo. The ground staff in New Delhi could not print boarding passes for my onward travel from Tokyo at Delhi at the checkin counter. When I asked them at the gate again they told it could have been done at checkin counter but can’t be done at the gate now. I reach Tokyo I am told to reach the gate without boarding pass. I spend my time panicking whether I will get a seat on the flight (so much for a relaxed travel and transit). Online checkin did not work since I am non-US passport holder. Ground staff shows up at the gate and I finally get a boarding pass but get stuck on a middle seat for next 11 hours which could have been avoided if I was checked in at New Delhi. Also I had called up JAL 3 days earlier requesting a special meal for all my flights, but the request was only put in for the first sector.",stuck on a middle seat
Japan Airlines,"I booked the flight on JAL website for the end of October 2018 to fly with the Boeing 787-9 not yet having tried. At the end of the purchase after checking my email, after 5 minutes I get an email alert that the flight booked from Helsinki to Tokyo started no longer at 17.05 as a reservation but at 17.25 and asked me to accept or refuse. I accepted in good faith  in exchange for Narita I lost the connection to Nagoya and I have to wait 9 hours to Narita. (I made the mistake of not checking and I did not think that JAL had only 2 daily flights to Nagoya). I contacted JAL through different channels but all told me that if I wanted to board the flight before I had to pay the penalty of 180€ + processing costs (the flight from Helsinki should arrive at 9 but I checked always arrives for 8.15-8.30 flight to Nagoya leaves at 9.55 and it is feasible to get on board). I'm a frequent flyer member JAL, but from now on with this treatment to the customers I can assure that JAL has lost a client.",JAL has lost a client

Japan Airlines,"This was my first time traveling with Japan Airlines and  I could not have been more happier. I made sure to arrive early to check in as me & my partner could not find any seats together. Upon talking to the check in staff they were able to give us a free upgrade to premium economy in order to compensate not being able to have me and my partner seated together on our booked economy fare. I was so shocked by the kindness and sincere empathy the check in staff had in regards to my situation. It was definitely an amazing start to the trip. Apart from being upgraded, JAL's amazing service continued to shine through its efficient ground staff, seat product and service on board. My first encounter with Japanese efficiency transpired with JAL's extremely fast and efficient boarding process. I was one of the first to board and it felt like 5 minutes after I sat down we were already on pushback, boarding literally took about 10 minutes which was amazing for a full flight. Boarding being done quickly meant we had a prompt ahead of schedule departure which was fantastic knowing how busy Sydney Airport can get traffic wise during the morning rush. Staff were very welcoming and friendly. Also, the cabin seemed extremely clean. The toilets were clean and hygienic. During meal service, staff were generous with the food & beverage offerings. Food is never an aspect of air travel I like, however, Japan Airlines offers a range of food options throughout the flight and you can pick up or ask for fresh food like instant noodles, chips, biscuits and chocolate. I couldn’t stomach the lunch service, however the instant noodles were a life saver. There was also regular hot towels distributed through the flight which made it a nice touch. One interesting observation I made was the lack of odour in the cabin. You know that strong aroma you get during the food service in which kind of makes you want to gag (well... at least for me)? Or when the cabin crew usually run drinks service and the whole cabin gets infused with the horrible bitterness of bad coffee? Well there was none of that here, It was very pleasant. I found JAL's IFE to be one of the most responsive I have experienced. The flight map is so interactive and explorable. You can zoom in and out of the map and get detailed views of your flight path. The entertainment selection was also excellent and there are movies in over 20 languages! Being onboard the Boeing 787 also meant the windows are big and the electronic tint provides a calming ambiance to the cabin. This is matched with the soft warm white lighting which was turned on after lunch so people could relax. And later on the flight when the lights were turned off a gentle purple illuminated the ceiling.  Overall, Japan Airlines proved to be one of the best carriers I have ever chosen to fly with. From the moment of check in to disembarkation, Japan Airlines truly lived up to my expectations of being a 5 star Skytrax airline.",one of the best carriers
Japan Airlines,"Flew Tokyo Narita to Kuala Lumpur. Check in line at Narita was not as efficient as expected of JAL and the queue was very long. Spent almost an hour in the line and the ground staff were not too friendly. Things changed on board as the service was impeccable as usual and the seats, in-flight entertainment, and meals were perfect.",the service was impeccable
Japan Airlines,"First time with Japan Airlines. The flight to Tokyo was late at night, so not much to report. The return flight was during the day and was mostly excellent. Highlights are the excellent service and the food. Just wonderful. Unfortunately, there are lows and they related to hardware and software. The seat is comfortable, however my window seat had almost no storage space except for among the magazines next to the screen (see pic). The IFE is truly sub-standard. Very few movies, the music select was small and in each category there were only a few tracks. Painful to operate as well. This is nickle and dime stuff in a premium product and a pity as the service is so very good.",Highlights are the excellent service
Japan Airlines,"Tokyo to Ho Chi Minh City. This is probably the best flight crew I have ever had. I lost a bag with souvenirs for my parents inside which is totally my responsibilty for losing it. I informed the police at the airport and he guided me to the information counter to the JAL staff. They were calling and running to get my lost package. This is amazing, never thought I could claim my baggage again. Through this I want to thank the police officer that helps me and staff from JL079.",the best flight crew
Japan Airlines,"Tokyo to San Diego. I have had four Japan Airlines flights in the past 30 days, all the flights were in business class. There is a huge difference between the business class offerings of these flights. The 787 is a great aircraft.  US Immigration in San Diego is quick and efficient. JL65/66 very poor and uncomfortable business class seats. I am very surprised that JAL would use old seats in a new aircraft. The pillow is tiny and inadequate. Service is not up to the normal JAL levels. Narita immigration is very slow. Positives for flights #01 & #02. - Super seat layout. - Very comfortable seats. Super attentive service. Haneda immigration is super fast.",old seats in a new aircraft
Japan Airlines,"Singapore to Tokyo Haneda. This is one airline I would definitely fly again if heading towards Japan or onwards to USA. It represents great value for money when compared to other premium Asian carriers who  charge 40-50% more for the same product / route. Haneda is a great airport and ground services are in line with any major international airport. Once onboard, one was greeted with warm smiles and friendly approachable service. In flight amenities are within expectation for J, with a (mouth) moisture mask, eye mask, toothbrush, hairbrush and ear plugs. Additionally a pyjama top  is also handed out sometime before or after meal service; as well as a refreshing eye moisture freshening mask before landing. Oddly though, the pyjama vest was offered to me on the day flight back but not the red eye going into TYO. As for the most crucial component of the flight, the herringbone arranged seat - cushion comfort is better than SQ though one still struggles with the non-linear layout somewhere between the pelvis (protruded by the outer front shell) and the left (or right depending on yr location) ankle position which comes into contact with the inner wall curvature. Food wise, the Japanese meal set was excellent- sushi and accompaniments were top notch and fresh. One could also enjoy premium arabica coffee, and on demand cup noodle snacks if needed. Overall, I would definitely try JAL out again simply because their service is excellent and the cabin product is in line with most of the premium Asian carriers.",their service is excellent
Japan Airlines,"JAL didn't disappoint for the most part. The check-in at Haneda was fast and accommodating. I say accommodating because they checked my luggage all the way through to my final destination on American Airlines connecting flight, despite the fact that these were two separate tickets. It seems a small thing, but it was major for me as JFK is a nightmare to connect through. On top of that, the agent gave me my boarding pass for the American flight! Onboard both directions the seats were wide and comfortable. I'm very large and I didn't feel particularly cramped or hindered even when in full recline. The seat cushions themselves are a bit thin, but they do have the extra air weave pads to help with this. Looking around the cabin, you can't help but feel it needs a refresher, but it is perfectly comfortable. The service onboard was kind and fast! They have an onboard order as you like service after the main meal and the food comes to you incredibly fast. The handset ordering function for this food was broken/unavailable both directions, but the response time of the FA was speedy. The food was good and you will not starve. However, if you are particular about your diet in any way, you may wish to order special meals. The western and the Japanese meals one way both featured beef which I don't eat. With the large a la carte menu it is easy enough to work around, but I found the set menus of the first meals to be really limited. AVOD was adequate and better than I remembered. Luggage delivery on the return from JFK was very slow, even for priority service. I'll probably fly them again, especially on the Haneda flights internationally.",seats were wide and comfortable
Japan Airlines,"Tokyo Narita to Vancouver on Boeing 787-8 in Economy. Was looking forward to this flight but was really disappointed. The aircraft is one of the first generation 787 and although it's not that old, it felt that way onboard. IFE is using Magic V on this particular aircraft, there was limited content and only few New Releases. Response time is good on the touch screen. Food is the part that I was most excited about but it turned out to be my biggest disappointment. It was probably my high expectation based on the promise of Collaboratively-designed menus by 6 young talented chef according to their website. I appreciated the metal cutlery though. The food itself tasted bland. The side dishes are OK and the miso soup was a nice touch but oh so salty.There are only 2 meal service and the last one does not give you a choice but the Soba was ok. They also does not give the whole can of Soda unless you ask for it specifically. Flight Crew - very polite, smiles a lot and efficient. Seat felt cramped and I'm only 165CM. When the passenger in front of me reclined her seat, the backseat TV was almost touching my face. Overall, the experience was not horrible. Would I fly JAL again? Most likely if the fare is good, but will bring my own food just to be on the safe side.",was really disappointed
Japan Airlines,"New York to Tokyo Narita. Return flight, same high quality service inflight as outgoing flight. Ground service at JFK a different story. Several check-in staff members unable or unwilling to speak Japanese to Japanese passengers, slowing check-in. Even with English-speaking passengers, check-in took 3x as long as at NRT and was not thorough (security and fragile item questions skipped). Saw staff I remember from previous years’ visits still dealing with passengers like newbies. Delays here compounded delays at security (due to TSA shift change and terminal flight departure bunching). T1 requires removal of suitcase belts due to outdated conveyer equipment. Check-in gate support by same ground staff with same problems.",same high quality service
Japan Airlines,"Tokyo to New York. Fast and efficient check-in at NRT; reliable, polite and thoughtful Japanese ‘omotenashi’ on-board service. FA checked with our group leader about student group member needs before departure, and followed up in flight. When they ran out of one of two dinner options at the back of the plane, I accepted what they had, but explained that I would have to eat around the main dish (curry) which contained shrimp I was allergic to. The FA asked for a few minutes, and after passing out the remaining meals, she disappeared into the galley, reappearing with a beef curry not on the menu. JAL also allows larger suitcases (203 instead of the standard 157cm). Unloading time average at JFK.",Fast and efficient check-in
Japan Airlines,"Tokyo Narita to Ho Chi Minh city. Terrible customer service at Narita airport. I had 2 hours layover at this airport to go to Ho Chi Minh city January 22, 2018. Around 5:30 pm we all were boarding and ready to depart but for some reason the airplane couldn’t fly any where and we were stuck inside for 5 hours then the pilot announced our fly is canceled. Our airplane went back to the terminal but the door couldn’t open because too much snow. So it took another one hour to get out off JAL airplane to go back to the terminal. We all got one sleeping bag, one bottle of water and a small bag of cracker for the night because of the snow storm. In the morning around 8 am we got in line to re book our ticket but all of employee at Narita airport told us we have to call JAL or book online because we were customer of yesterday they couldn’t help us in person. It’s was very disappointed with the way they handle there customers. Then we got in line to put our name and get number to get drawing at 3 pm the second day to see who is the lucky one can fly out. It’s seem like we all refugee waiting list to go back to wherever country. I was lucky that I met an Idian couple when I was charging my phone and later the husband help me to call local JAL to book my last seat at Haneda aiport which is one an half hour away by bus. My phone has international plan but couldn’t call local JAL number and 1800 JAL number took me hours but still no one pick up the phone. We were unlucky with the drawing so have to stay another night to get in to the waiting list at 4 pm fight for January 24,2018. The people at help desk gave us one night hotel which is 2 hours away. I asked the worker at help desk if my 3 friends they don’t want to go to the hotel that night could they have voucher for food instead but they no. I felt so bad for them because they have to stay another night at Narita airport with the same set of clothes. Any way there was a few nice employee try to help us by the end, one ask her boss to give me $30 to take bus to go to other airport to get the fly at 1:30 am. I was so tired because of two nights no sleep and stress out because I have 6 days left for my vacation. That’s was a very bad experience with the way JAL treat their customer. I hope they will learn from this and will help all of their customer like me who stuck at Narita airport for 32 hours or more.",was a very bad experience
Japan Airlines,"Tokyo to New York. Absolute worst customer service and experience with this Airline. On my honeymoon and paid for an upgrade on the way to my destination and halfway was downgraded. They blamed JFK for not properly communicating the upgrade was only halfway. Either way we got the runaround with a few different people at the Haneda Airport. Most notably was an incredibly rude manager, I was shocked when she said she was a manager because the way she spoke and handled this was incredibly unprofessional. I was interrupted nonstop by “no no solution unless you pay more”. Horrible experience I will never fly with this Airline again. Don’t use them if you want to avoid the worst headache and rude customer service. I would give zero stars if I could.",worst customer service
Japan Airlines,Bangkok to Chicago via Tokyo. Won't be flying them again. Arrived at the airport at 6 for my international 8am flight which was delayed. At noon they cancelled the flight. They have 1 person helping customers getting on new flights. Most people are stuck here an additional 24 hours. Absolutely terrible customer service. There are about 30 furious people here still waiting for hours to get on flights. The best they are offering is getting in 24 hours late.,terrible customer service
Japan Airlines,Chitose to Kushiro. The cabin crew were smiling and I felt really welcome. The boarding and the seating were a breeze and the airline provides small headphones that you can take with you. One of the cabin crew members gave us free JAL Aircraft Models as gifts and kept asking us if we wanted more Apple Juice. The seats were very comfortable and the legroom was more than enough for relaxation. The only thing that did not work properly was the free WIFI. I will definitely fly with JAL again.,I felt really welcome
Japan Airlines,"Tokyo Narita to Taipei. The crew efficiency was a big problem, they do not offer welcome drink when you board the plane. The meal service was a disaster, the speed was really slow and they did not offer the drink service before meal. They just gave you a whole tray. It took one hour from I boarded the plane to I got my first drink. Also the taste of the meal was really bad. I would never spend money to buy their business class ticket.",do not offer welcome drink
Japan Airlines,"Taipei to Narita. This was an really disappointing flight. The meal was terrible, it looks really nice but the taste was really bad. Also the staff was lack of efficiency. The meal service go through very slow, the service was really bland. The dessert they offered was just a really small size Haagen-Dazs ice cream. I am so disappointing. Also the IFE system was a disaster, the speed was really slow and the interface was really not user friendly.",IFE system a disaster
Japan Airlines,"Japan Airlines customer care team in Hong Kong is the worst, rude, no manner and helpless. When I book tickets via gotogate website, there was no field to put in middle name on the ticket. I called the Japan Airlines many times to help me to insert the middle names on the tickets for my family but they offered no helps, they said Airlines will refuse our entry at the airport and we have to paid very high fees to get new tickets, they charged us $390 to cancel each ticker plus fair different. Airlines ruined my family holidays trip.",ruined my family holidays trip
Japan Airlines,"I flew JL773 on the return leg of the Melbourne - Tokyo Narita - Melbourne journey in September 2017. There was no queue at check-in, immigration was smooth and Narita T2 seemed a little quiet after the Passport Control. Upon arriving at Gate 84, it was even quieter, and boarding was orderly and strictly conducted according to oneworld membership tier and class of travel. JAL’s 788 V2 (SS8) has a generous 2-4-2 configuration in Economy, with 18.9” Seat Width and 33” Seat Pitch. The rear section has 88 seats, which easily composes a relaxed cabin ambience, especially when it was only one third full. IFE was sensitive to touch, sophisticated and loaded with international and classic titles. In-flight Wi-Fi service has three prices when paying by normal credit card, US$10.15 for 1 hour, US$14.40 for 3 hours and US$18.80 for 24 hours. If you are paying with a JAL Card, the prices are US$9.15, US$12.95 and US$16.80 respectively. Asked one Cabin Crew in particular a specific loading question, she was visibly annoyed. The Cabin Manager noticed the situation and personally came to apologise for the ‘service attitude’ and gave me a small present from the Captain. For the remainder of the journey, I received unprecedented and somewhat uncomfortable levels of pampering attentions from the crew members. Two meals were served after takeoff with five or six types of grain or chocolate made snacks readily available between meals. The first full meal was designed by JAL’s one of six RED U-35 Cooks, including Kazutoyo Inoue from Szechwan Restaurant Chen. The second proper meal ‘Air Yoshinoya’ came in the form of a bento box, which was served exactly two hours before touchdown. In-flight beverage list contains 10 types of Soft Drinks including the JAL Original Drink - SKY TIME “Kiwi”, and wine, beer, sake, whisky, gin, vodka, brandy and plum, a total of 8 varieties of Alcoholic Drinks. The actual flight took 09 hours and 54 minutes, travelled 8,377 km and reached the gate 34 minutes before the scheduled arrival.",boarding was orderly and strictly conducted
Japan Airlines,"Tokyo Narita to Melbourne. Excellent business class seat and attentive service, Sat in 9C and you could not hear Premium Economy section. Son sat in 9A and loved the privacy of the window pod. Onboard WIFI the fastest and most reliable I have come across in the ski. Five star business class experience on-board. The First Class lounge in the Satellite area at Narita though was pretty basic. Would have been rated a 10 if the bed when flat was another couple of inches longer (note I am 6 foot 2 inches tall)",Excellent business class seat
Japan Airlines,"Boston to Hong Kong via Tokyo. Really great service, however, long haul flights, the seating in business class is so uncomfortable. This was my first time flying JAL, and typically I would not write a review, but after clocking almost 40 hours on JAL in 1 week, I feel I need to point out the seating situation. Now for the price of biz class - its great, but after working for a few hours, a movie and dinner, it is almost impossible to get comfortable for a sleep. In fact, because of these seats, I left with severe cramping.  Again, the service was great. Very friendly, and they go out of there way to provide exceptional service, however, the seating needs some work.",seating needs some work
Japan Airlines,"Tokyo Haneda to London. Flight was okay in business class on Boeing 777, not my chosen airline but paid for by client. I have used ANA on previous London/Tokyo trips and ANA are superior to Japan Airlines, they seem more international and staff are much nicer. Check in and lounge in Tokyo was efficient (lounge rather crowded), seat onboard Boeing 777 was comfortable, but cabin temperature was unbearably hot and stuffy (to suit Japanese passengers). Food was passable (again, well below ANA), inflight entertainment is poor. Clean cabin, poor washrooms (no amenities at all). I can see what ANA is 5-Star compared to Japan Airlines.",ANA are superior to Japan Airlines
Japan Airlines,"Singapore to Tokyo Haneda. The flight was delayed for 30 minutes which was okay. When I was boarding, there was two flight attendants standing by the door to greet and apologise for the delay to the passengers. After take off, dinner was served. I would say Japan Airlines has a good selection of meals in economy class. The FAs on this flight was attentive and helpful. The IFE screen on my seat wasn't working, so the FA reseated me. Prior to landing, a Japanese style breakfast was served on board. It was delicious. Overall, I would say that this flight was awesome thanks to cabin crew. Good job.",awesome thanks to cabin crew
Japan Airlines,"What an exceptional First Class Journey from stepping onboard to leaving the door. I was greeted at the door of the aircraft and ushered left to seat 1A. I was instantly served Salon 2006 Champagne and shortly afterwards offered leisure clothing of my size, and offered that opportunity to change into it before departure. The bathroom had a padded drop-down floor and seat so that you didn’t have to stand on the floor or toilet to change! Then all five staff working in First Class bowed and introduced themselves, and the Japanese 9-cousre menu started shortly after take-off. Many fine champagnes and sakis were offered and enjoyed, as well as the offer of the entire Japanese menu after mentioning that I had not tried many Japanese cuisines. As there were only two people occupying the 8-seat First Class cabin, the crew made up the suite opposite into a bed for me so I could sleep when it suited me. After about 3 hours of sleep they asked me if I wanted more food and drink. Nearing arrival, I was presented with a bag containing a Business Class amenity kit (having complimented them on the First Class Porsche Design kit, and they wanted me to have a Zero Halliburton one), some Japanese photos and two bottles of water for my onward journey. If only BA could provide anything near such perfection. JAL is wonderful and their premium product is perfection!!",an exceptional First Class
Japan Airlines,"Frankfurt to Tokyo in business class. Seats were quite confortable although rather narrow for sleeping, and the cabin was overheated for non Japanese passengers, but staff don't seem to care. I have now flown this route with LH, ANA and Japan Airlines, and have to say that Japan Airlines are below standards of others. Cabin attendants speak very poor English (they have foreign CA), and the service is so slow and rather poor. I didn't expect them to be this poor, and a long way behind their rival ANA (who I will choose on next trip).",long way behind rival ANA
Japan Airlines,"Tokyo to Honolulu. This trip to Hawaii I splashed out on their premium economy. It is a great value considering the services provided. You get designated check-in, priority luggage check, and access to the Sakura Lounge at Narita. Because it was a late night flight, people like myself were eating full meals in the lounge in order to skip the late night dinner service onboard. Plenty to choose from: teriyaki chicken over rice, their famous beef curry over rice, dim sum, soup, sandwiches, and Thai curry were some of the choices. We also got a massage and a shower in before boarding the aircraft. Of course, people did eat on board, too, which consisted of a posh Tokyo yoshoku chain called Shiseido Parlour and while I didn't eat anything, the meals definitely looked better than your average economy meal. The seats are a little hard after 5 hours and the recline is the slide type which many people dislike, but since I can't sleep on planes anyway, it didn't bother me. There is ample space both in width and in leg room. The service is flawless. The AVOD was adequate. A smooth flight going over. Coming back, the 787 was even better. The toilet in economy with a washlet was a welcome treat. There were two babies traveling in the front row of premium and they were treated like kings! The older flight attendants doted over them the entire flight with special meals, chatting, games and toys, and of course bassinets. The power port at my seat didn't work, and the wifi on offer never seemed to either. I'm now a regular with JAL and I don't think I'll be changing anytime soon.",now a regular with JAL
Japan Airlines,"The very flight happened to be Japan Airlines 50th Anniversary of Tokyo-Kuala Lumpur route. I got my class of service upgraded from Economy to Premium Economy at the time of check in for nominal charges. The seats of the aircraft was very nice and the cabin was very clean. Some negative things to note. The food. The menu was introduced to have been developed by Naomi Iijima, a food designer. I had a small bite of everything and none of them was acceptable. Though designed to look fancy, everything tasted terrible. I'd say regular meal that you'd expect on economy class by other airlines would be far better. Cabin Attendants English was not good. Very unclear and hard to understand. The attitude of CA towards passengers was not something that worth a compliment. Cabin Entertainment menu offered is quite limited. The flight arrived at KL and was greeted with water arch. At least that was a little fun.",the cabin was very clean
Japan Airlines,JAL continues to shine! This is not the first time I rode Japan Airlines but it never fails to impress. The cabin attendants from Tokyo to Dallas were all outstanding. They did not only smile but cared for every passenger genuinely. They paid close attention to details such as walking softly so as not to disturb passengers. Meals were elegant and plentiful. The seat has a lot of privacy and Japan Airlines further increased comfort by providing mattress. Overall a perfect flight again!,a perfect flight again
Japan Airlines,"This was an excellent flight from Paris CDG to Tokyo Narita. Compared to Premium Economy on some airlines, JAL seems to provide more space, with a hard but quite comfortable seat, a big table and entertainment screen, and a good legrest that really helped provide support. I can't usually sleep much on flights but on this one slept for around 5 hours. Food is standard economy (with a few extras such as champagne) but good in terms of both quantity and quality. The plane seemed new and was kept clean throughout, and there were useful extras such as mouthwash available in the toilets. I would definitely fly Japan Airlines again.",this was an excellent flight
Japan Airlines,"Frankfurt to Tokyo. This airline topped other airlines I have flown with before! Before my flight I had a few questions about my booking so I decided to email them. I was surprised that I got answer the following day! Same goes for the phonecall. I called since I had a codeshare ticket, and the online check-in did not work for me. I expected to be waiting on the line, and was so surprised when a very cheerful woman answered after a few seconds! It was my first long-haul solo flight and I felt a bit anxious. Without saying anything to the staff, they would check on me very often, making sure I was comfortable. The staff was very competent, and spoke Japanese, English, and German. The time on the flight to Tokyo passed very quickly thanks to the inflight entertainment.",topped other airlines
Japan Airlines,"Japan Airlines is excellent. First flight was from Osaka to Los Angeles. Solidly good with good departure and arrival time. Also flew from Narita to the Philippines and both experiences were above my expectations. I had arrived early at the airport and they let me choose my seat on the plane. The Japanese staff are world class! It was my first time flying across the Pacific and they made my flight very comfortable. The cabin crew were very attentive, helpful and accommodating. The food was good, there was no charge for liquor and the lavatory was fairly clean. Great selection of movies to pass the time. They could do better if they provided the inflight wifi service, but aside from that, definitely would fly with them again.",above my expectations
Japan Airlines,"Both legs (Haneda-Bangkok, Bangkok-Haneda) were red-eye flights. The quality of catering was much better on the outbound flight (HND-BKK). However, there were no choices on both legs. I really think Japan Airlines should provide meal choices for their passengers. Service-wise, the crew on both flights (BKK-HND) were indifferent and not really friendly towards the passengers. There were Bangkok-based crew as well, and there is a big difference among the Bangkok-based crew. Some were really good but some were not so friendly.",crew on both flights were indifferent
Japan Airlines,Japan Airlines from Hong Kong to Tokyo Narita in economy class. The attention to detail by its ground staff and cabin attendants was exceptional. There were both Hong Kong and Japan based cabin attendants and they were providing excellent service. The aircraft did not have the Sky Wider seats but the seats were still very comfortable for a regional flight. Quality of inflight meals was very good although there was no option. The cabin of Japan Airlines was very quiet which made the whole flight very enjoyable.,providing excellent service
Japan Airlines,"Shanghai to Kansai. I chose Japan Airlines because of its cheap ticket and the service was really good. Delicious food for a flight under two hours. A very comfortable seat which could help me have a good rest. IFE was enough for me. And the cabin crew were professional. Next time, I will put JAL into consideration if I take the flight between PVG and KIX again.",cabin crew were professional
Japan Airlines,"Absolutely the best Tokyo to Sydney option. It does use Narita as opposed to Haneda, but JAL certainly makes up for the slight inconvenience due to the distance to the city. Firstly their fare is cheaper than Qantas, and even the Jetstar flight via the Gold Coast. Secondly their luggage allowance is more generous (23kg x 2 check-in) so it was a nice surprise to be able to relax at the airport baggage-free. Thirdly their staff, both ground and air, were so competent. They were efficient and knew not to disturb you unnecessarily, while keeping the signature Japanese Omotenashi mind. Also they serve you plenty of drinks and quality food, with warm breakfast. I did think the flavour was too much to the Japanese liking (e.g. they served rice-featured breakfast and no other options, if I'm not mistaken), but it was one of the best economy class meals around.  could not stress more how wonderful the spaciousness of the JAL Sky Wider seat arrangement was.  The only complaint is the range of movies and TV shows shown. Qantas offers more alternatives than JAL and ANA's typical blockbusters and Friends. Overall, JAL will be my chosen option in the future for this route, unless Qantas lowers their price, as I'm their FF member.",my chosen option for this route
Japan Airlines,Singapore to Tokyo Haneda in October. Seat pitch and leg room was very good with much space to stretch out. The flight was operated by a Boeing 767-300ER with seats in a 2-3-2 layout.  Seat recline was good. Breakfast was served on this sector and was a breakfast soup which was surprisingly filling. Cabin staff were polite and attentive. IFE was very good and responsive. The large IFE screen was very clear and modern. Prices were lower than ANA and Singapore Airlines.,leg room was very good
Japan Airlines,"Sapporo to London Heathrow via Tokyo Haneda with Japan Airlines. Incredible crew, nice and helpful. International and Japanese food better than BA with metal cutlery in economy class. Free snacks in economy - simple, but better than nothing. Seats on longhaul flights have a lot of knee space with cool canvas seats, very good customizable headrests with foldable sides, so you can fix your head when sleeping - good pillows - entertainment system about the same quality, but maybe BA had more choice. Domestic flight with B777-200 - configuration 3-4-3. JAL looks more tailored to Japanese customers - they have all major japanese beers - Asahi, Sapporo, Kirin etc. Very pleasant experience even on a full flights - combination of good seats, good food, and good crew.",Japan Airlines customer review
Japan Airlines,"By far the best economy trip I have taken. We fly economy for vacation trips, which this was. Although I chose Japan Airlines for our trip to Japan and Hong Kong because we had heard that the service and food on this airline were excellent, we were not expecting much. My frame of reference was the routine abuse perpetrated on economy passengers by U.S. airlines. I could not have been more pleasantly surprised - and quite frankly shocked - by the great experience we had on Japan Airlines. The service was just excellent. Courteous, attentive cabin crews, genuinely interested in the comfort and care of passengers. Need some assistance by turning on the cabin attendant light? A cabin crew member will rush over to see what you need. Plenty of good food and beverages served throughout the flight. Think you're thirsty? Well, a cabin attendant just happens to walk by with juice or water. The economy seats we had were very comfortable, even for the long journeys we had. The 787 is a wonderful airplane to fly in. Perhaps it may seem like I am gushing here, but compared to the torture of U.S. airlines, it was nirvana. If I return to the Far East again, this is the airline I am going to use.",the service was just excellent
Japan Airlines,"Chicago to Tokyo Narita. I had never flown with Japan Airlines before, so my first impression was very positive. Very attentive, gracious and courteous crew, as well as the ground crew.  Drinks and food were substantial. Snacks and water were available throughout the flight. In-flight entertainment was adequate.",impression was very positive
Japan Airlines,"Tokyo Haneda to Singapore. Highly impressed with my first flight with Japan Airlines in a few years. Ground staff were attentive and genuine which set a nice first impression. Seating was comfortable on Boeing 767 window seat with sufficient leg room. Midnight departure meant a small snack and drink after take off, beer was served ice cold, a big plus! Enjoyed the entertainment system though range not as diverse as other airlines. Breakfast served 2.5 hours before landing, quite tasty with tea and coffee plentiful. Friendly service with a smile, look forward to my next flight with Japan Airlines!",staff were attentive and genuine
Japan Airlines,"Red eye flight from Haneda to Bangkok with Japan Airlines. Boarding was speedy and efficient. After take-off, light snack, bread, and drinks were offered. A bottle of mineral water was offered to each passenger too. However, unlike other carriers, the flight attendants did not go around with drinks. There was only one choice for breakfast but it was great.",did not go around with drinks
Japan Airlines,"Beijing to Tokyo was a good flight, on time. Morning 8am flight but served hot beef rice that is good. Cabin service great though the cabin staff speak little English. Have not flown JAL for a long time and it was a happy return. The Boeing 787 aircraft has innovations such as a blacking out window shade. Will use JAL on the same route again.",cabin staff speak little English
Japan Airlines,"I flew from Osaka to Sapporo with JAL, the staff fluent in English and understandable. Everything perfect except free Wi-FI on board that never worked. JAL was extremely user-minded and friendly. A pleasant surprise.",extremely user-minded
Japan Airlines,"Takamatsu to Tokyo Haneda. The flight was the last flight of the evening on August 11, the start of the summer (obon) holiday season in Japan. Unfortunately the flight was delayed by over an hour but the ground staff was very apologetic and helpful. The cabin crew looked very worried that people would be angry as the announcement was made in the terminal but they were very courteous during the flight and did their best to keep us happy for the flight to Tokyo. I couldn't fully understand the announcement (in Japanese) of the delay at the gate so I asked the ground staff to confirm my thoughts. They apologized many times for the delay as well as for speaking too fast for me to understand everything they said during the official announcement. I did understand them for the most part but needed to confirm the information. The ground staff was very courteous and helpful. Great service for a stressful time by the ground crew and cabin crew.",staff very courteous and helpful
Japan Airlines,"Tokyo Narita to Hanoi. Boarding was orderly and efficient. Due to air traffic congestion in Narita, we departed late.However, we managed to land on time. The crew were polite and efficient. The seat was really comfortable and the IFE were really great. Food was really tasty too. However, the aircraft was a little warm throughout the flight. Overall, a great flight with Japan Airlines.",great flight with Japan Airlines
Japan Airlines,Japan Airlines from Taipei to Los Angeles via Kansai return. It might not have the best inflight entertainment or the best economy seat but cabin attendants were top notch. They were professional and efficient with great attention to detail. They walked around the cabin handing out drinks during the flight. I had the best inflight meal I have had.,professional and efficient
Japan Airlines,"Tokyo to Frankfurt. They ran out of Japanese food and all breakfast options on Business Class. I had pot noodle for breakfast on Business Class. I was offered a bottle of sake on plane but they do not stock resealable bags on board, so could not accept this due to connecting flight and airport security, they did not offer to post it to my home address. On outbound flight they did not place us sitting together even though booked under one reference and requested to sit together a month in advance of travel, had to complain at the gate in order to get seats assigned together. After complaining after experience, Japan Airlines did not offer any apology, so would not recommend based on overall service, food and seating arrangements.",not recommend on overall service
Japan Airlines,"San Francisco to Kuala Lumpur via Tokyo Haneda. We had to change airports in Tokyo but it was worth it for the ticket price because they have reliable and not too expensive bus service between airports. Overall, flying with JAL was a good experience. The legroom in economy class was plentiful and the seats were comfortable. Flight attendant service was good as well and there was a decent selection of movies to watch on seat back monitors. My complaint is that the food on flights between SF to Tokyo didn't seem adequate for a 10 hour flight, which is long. They provided 1 full meal and 1 little dinky (tiny!) sandwich with no condiments, so remember to bring snacks. The lack of condiments on the sandwich and the fact that it was cold made it extremely dry and barely edible. On the other hand, the full meal they served were good, my only complaint being that they did not heat up the bread rolls. I've flown on many trans pacific flights between the US and Asia with other airlines and they have always provided 2 full meals. But as a whole, the JAL flying experience was quite nice and I wouldn't hesitate to fly with them again. Bonus points for the fancy bidets found in Japanese airports.",flying experience was quite nice
Japan Airlines,"Ticket purchased online with Japan Airlines. Process is easy and allows check-in up to 72 hours prior to scheduled departure. Check-in at airport was quick and efficient, staff helpful and friendly. Flight from Sydney to Narita departed early, as all passengers and crew were ready to embark. Wi-fi only available gratis in Business or First Class, or for a charge if you are in Premium Economy or Economy providing you have an account with JAL. Catering was of a good standard, with reasonable selection of food, drinks and snacks. Flight was smooth, with pleasant climate maintained inside the aircraft. Arrival was ahead of schedule and disembarkation was well organised. Overall, having experienced Premium Economy (PE) with CX, I found the JAL PE to be sub-standard. Apart from the PE seats in JAL and a separate check-in counter, the catering, baggage allowance, etc.. is exactly the same as Economy. Considering the new Economy seats in JAL, I believe Economy is much better value for money. Maybe CX PE experience has spoiled me!",found JAL PE to be sub-standard
Japan Airlines,"Bangkok to Haneda with Japan Airlines. Lounge was packed prior to the 09:45 departure to Haneda. Business class forward cabin looked cramped, although fresh and spotless. 7-across angle-flat seating is surely now outdated and was not very comfortable, especially with the seat itself being quite hard. Not really a problem for a daytime flight, but I would be very unhappy to find this layout on the inward overnight flight. Reasonable IFE selection but small screen. My main complaint is the lunch service. With limited main course selection taken at take-off and the first course not delivered until an hour later, you'd think the service from then on would be relatively speedy. Not so! A full 40-minute wait between the first two courses is quite unforgivable, the more so when I had to return my steak as it was not even lukewarm! Thereafter the flight was uneventful, although it was all but impossible to hear the cabin service announcements. Departed on time and arrived 10 minutes early.",seating is surely now outdated
Japan Airlines,"Bangkok to Los Angeles via Kansai. Another flawless performance by Japan Airlines. Check in was quick and easy, because of their competence and the Boeing 787 is a relatively small airplane, but which still gives economy passengers generous room. The staff were competent and polite and the flight was as pleasant as a flight that long could be. All 4 flights were on time and planes were spotless. There was a wide variety of entertainment on the flight, though I could not find anything I wanted to watch.",staff were competent and polite
Japan Airlines,"I had one of the most pleasant flying experience with Japan Airlines from New York JFK to Tokyo Narita. I had heard about their Boeing 777 Sky Wider Economy seating, with only 9 abreast (opposed to commonly used 10 abreast) and a generous seat width and pitch, plus some other nice features. I always wondered if an inch or two here or there really count. I was wrong. It does matter and with one less seat in a row, made an enormous difference on this 13+ hours flight. A pre-meal drink service was followed by a 7 dish lunch, including miso soup and ice cream. Another meal was served before landing. What set them apart was the staff who were caring, polite and courteous. The kind of service which is becoming rare or found only in premium cabins. They made numerous rounds with drinks during the flight. I saw them caring for babies and observed one of the crew making an origami for them in the galley. Entertainment system was adequate with high quality screen displays. Announcements in English could be clearer. My Oneworld Sapphire status (AA Platinum) was fully acknowledged at the check-in counter and other ground services.",service which is becoming rare
Japan Airlines,"Singapore to Los Angeles via Tokyo, and I am very impressed by Japan Airlines. The service and food were good, leg room was sufficient, and seats were one of the most comfortable I have sat on. Though the variety of entertainment was not great, it was sufficient for the long haul flight that I was on.",I am very impressed
Turkish Airlines,"Do not waste money on a Business Class flight. The business class experience is a bit of a joke: don't waste money on Business and just fly economy where you will probably get three seats to yourself and decent food/drink. In Business, he menu has been changed and has been reduced to an omelette or Indian vegetables. Whilst allowances could be made for THY return flights to IST from KTM, it is inexcusable for such a poor food offer to Business Class passengers. The pre-arrival offer (food) was samosas. On arrival at KTM, business class passengers did not get express treatment to the arrival lounge (unlike all previous flights) and I spent nearly two hours before exiting the airport. The IST-KTM route offer has deteriorated to such an extent that I - despite 10+ trips on this route in business - would not recommend using THY.",don't waste money on Business
Turkish Airlines,"The plane was antiquated, my footrest box under the TV was so contorted, my seat would not recline into a lie-flat without me getting up and trying to manipulate it whilst using the control panel. I tried to engage the cabin crew but they seemed indifferent and just shrugged their shoulders. The power supplies are completely useless as they are in a confined / dark spot which you need your phone torch to be able to see - do not bring an oversized electric plug (the ones you get with most laptops nowadays) as it will simply not fit. I ended up using two travel adaptors to extend the the power plug which I then wedged with my mobile phone. The 'sky-chef' is a complete gimmick. They simply arrange food on a plate and are totally inflexible. I asked if I could have my meal a little later than scheduled but was met with a stern 'no'. I have photos of the defective footrests and the power supply.",cabin crew they seemed indifferent
Turkish Airlines,"My journey began in San Diego with a limo bus to LAX. Nearly everybody in the limo seemed to be travelling on Turkish and to beyond Istanbul. The driver said all their services are full of passengers for THY. If you are listening Turkish Airlines, think about a few flights to San Diego with its upcoming new terminal! Check-in was open very early, and painless, by a very polite agent. Boarding was chaotic. The first boarding announcement began half way through another announcement about another flight being made throughout the terminal. The agent spoke with her back to the boarding gates and said which passenger groups to wait on the left and which on the right. But it transpired she meant on our left and right even though she indicated her left and right. Consequently the lines were totally full of the wrong passengers. Eventually we found the right lines and entered through the boarding gates which also took our photos in the process. Apart from the boarding mix-up, I would say the process in LAX was very good. After boarding the Captain announced 20 minutes delay in start-up due to some luggage compartment problems. My seat was near the back and I could hear loud noises of containers rumbling around. But she was exactly right and after 20 minutes we started up and took off. Amenity packs and Menus were distributed, followed by the first meal. The crew on this flight were very relaxed and courteous as they served us. On my way out from Istanbul I had been in Business Class but the crew there all seemed in a rush, even though the flight was over twelve hours. Everybody settled down to sleep as the sun could be seen coming up and then setting again through a few open window shades. A self-service snack and drinks were available in the galleys during the night. Near the end of the flight another hot meal with choice of entrée was served. We landed on time and endured the inevitable long ground time at Istanbul Airport before we reached our gate. Long long walks to İmmigration, and another long walk to the most distant luggage carousel, even though there were many empty ones near the centre of Arrivals. But. Our luggage was already going round; Istanbul Airport luggage is always so fast. Overall an excellent flight.",Overall an excellent flight
Turkish Airlines,"Horrible experience. First they messed-up our seats, and me and my wife were separated during the self check in at the Istanbul airport. It took a lot of back and forth with the ground staff to get them to switch our seats so that we can sit together. The staff was of no help, and kept trying to persuade me that seat reservations don't matter even though I paid for them. They did try to offer me to pay for an upgrade to business class. The plane was really old, seats were far too small.",seats were far too small
Turkish Airlines,"We landed in Istanbul at the 6:50 time but only left the aircraft at 7:15. We had a few mins to make it from gate A4 to F8 and our security checkpoint was only manned by 1 team with a second added for the last few minutes and once we cleared this 7:50 I ran to the gate making it there at 8:00. Being informed the gate had closed I was directed to customer service. I was met by 2 rude female attendees who could care less why we were delayed and their response was simply that the hour from landing to take off was sufficient to make the flight and I would need to buy a new ticket. We requested a manager and no manager, with the only direction to go to the main desk. When we got here the person attending us once more was unfriendly, we shifted computers 3 times to be told go to ticket desk so I asked what is they will do there that you cannot and I was told to buy a new ticket and that he was done assisting us and called the next person in line. Ground staff are extremely rude and I will never fly this airline even though they are part of Star Alliance to which I am a gold member currently. If this is the welcome you give guests I hope someone will read this and think twice about coming to Turkey as the experience I've had here is awful.",Ground staff are extremely rude

But the luggage did not reach the destination. We had to make a 700 km round trip the next day to retrieve them. On the return they were late and 4 of the 6 bags arrived destroyed and at the complaints office I found out that this is something common with this company. The compensation process for the 4 bags is not completed after a month, the company trying all kinds of situations in order not to compensate.

Turkish Airlines,"After we checked in and dropped the luggage, after the passport control, we went to the gate where we waited around 90 minutes until a message appeared on the monitors. Canceled flight. Confusion, long faces. After 15 minutes, a young lady shows up and says to go back to take our luggage, to cancel the exit visa and to meet in front of the check in desk. After 4 hours, we were taken to a hotel to rest. Next day we asked the receptionist when we will leave. He didn't know. We tried to contact the TA offices. Nobody answered. We emailed the offices in Buenos Aires and Turkey. No reply. We were left without any news for 3 days until we received an email saying that we should be ready in 3 hours to take the shuttle bus to the airport. Other people were looking at us asking if we know when they could go because they didn't have any indication from the airline company. We were ready at the right time. No shuttle bus. After numerous calls from us and hotel reception a shuttle bus arrived after 90 minutes the scheduled time of arrival. It was a nightmare! We couldn't go out the hotel because we waited a sign from the airline company and the data download cost is prohibitive, so we stayed mainly in the hotel lobby where we had wi-fi. Avoid at any cost this company. The stress was huge.",It was a nightmare!

But there is a very interesting detail on my flights to and from Venezuela, that the necessary water is not easily delivered to the guest. When I had been ordering wine and water, I only got wine, when juice with water: the same procedure. Wondering about the Turkish guests in the flight, all with separate cans of beer or juice, outside the normal serving, I discovered that they had been getting that in the rear of the plane. As well water could be obtained easily there. But no official announcement has been given us.",water is not easily delivered
Turkish Airlines,"Horror story - three faulty flights out of four! First flight out of Miami was late by 4 hours. Next flight out of IST to Varna - a 40 min flight - canceled and moved to the next day, all at last minute. Staff at MIA said they'll put me in a hotel, which didn't happen. Airport employees were incredibly rude and condescending - eyerolls, and just directed to go to the opposite end of the huge airport - for any question asked, or just said I don't know anything. What their site says and what their staff says and what their phone agents say - all different. The second flight that was canceled and moved to the next day - also had a technical problem - after already accelerating on the runway, it started breaking sharply, and the pilot announced that they have to fix something which resulted in an hour sitting on the plane being surrounded by service vehicles. No response to the filed complaint. Flight from IST to Miami - a 12.5 hr flight, was turned back after an hour+ in the air because lavatory system not working, and then was circling around for a long time after flying back to Istanbul.

Turkish Airlines,"I was denied boarding despite having been issued boarding pass and an allocated seat. I had completed an online check-in the previous day, then checked-in at the airport check in counter with my hold luggage three hours prior to my flight departure, followed by entering the departure gate in plenty of time, although no boarding time had been indicated on my boarding ticket. Minutes before I got through to the gate, there was an announcement for the standby individuals’ that TK are selling seats for 400 euros. Despite the staff member checking my boarding pass, detailing that I am safe as I have an allocated seat, another staff member approached the desk, closed the barrier in front of us and the gate door behind us, and said that boarding is denied which included 11 passengers in total. We then witnessed the remaining passengers board the flight, including the individuals on standby, and us being held behind this barrier and experiencing eight hours of a very stressful situation at Istanbul Airport with a lack of customer care and welfare. Essentially being left stranded at the airport. The customer service desk staff denied us compensation on the basis that although the flight had been overbooked, all 11 passengers had been late (not true), but to solve this issue, we need to rebook and pay ourselves for another flight, then will they will assist. Despite having been given a leaflet for ‘Turkish Airlines Passengers Rights’ which details Turkish Airlines compensation for denied boarding/ overbooking (after about 6 hours of discussions), TK had continued ignoring our requests. There was no willingness to try to help, nor provide welfare, no food, accommodation, or lounge access. Despite spending eight hours in customer service, the issue was partially resolved for me and another passenger after TK had us booked onto the next flight to Edinburgh the following morning. However, other passengers had booked themselves onto other flights paying with their own money. The attitude and service was atrocious and unacceptable.",attitude and service was atrocious

Additional information about this appeared on the website, which was not there when I bought the ticket. However, later I was able to find a message that some types of equipment, including ski equipment, can be brought for free.

I had to stay 6 hours near the gate, I wasn't able to leave the airport because they didn't say when they are going to onboard passengers.  My daughter tried to reschedule it but they were very rude and they have only one answer, we can't help. The flight from Cairo to SFO on 1st September 2023 also got delayed and I missed my connection flight to SFO which caused me to overnight at Istanbul airport.

The only way this airline will learn is if you boycott it which I strongly recommend.",“how can luggage not arrive”
Turkish Airlines,"Terribly unpleasant experience, would seriously recommend to avoid this airline at all costs. They reschedule flights continuously, the last one was 13 hours later than scheduled and then they decide to offer less as a refund because their system likes to steal money from good paying customers. They have a rediculous customer service team that cannot process refunds and will make you wait 7 working days for a 'feedback' response and then another 7 working days for the refund itself which is ludicrous in this day and age for electronic payments. It screams of an airline in trouble finding ways to dupe people out of their money and holding onto it before it goes bust, please avoid and save yourself the stress.",avoid and save yourself the stress
Turkish Airlines,"Online customer service is horrible. Communication via Whatsapp is a useless bot. Communication via Twitter X are mostly incompetent robot-acting humans. They just copy and paste information from their website instead of answering questions like a human being. System is terribly flawed. I understand that purchased seat selections reset when the flight schedule changes but they should also allow customers to get their purchased seats reassigned back to them. I had to make a new payment and repurchase them while they sneakily refund less than half of what I paid until I emailed them and pointed out the error. I wasted my money purchasing extra baggage because the online person said combined baggage for group is not allowed. But when I checked-in at the airport, turns out it IS allowed. On the contrary, all the ground staff and cabin crew (international and domestic) are very kind, provided excellent service, food is great. Seats are big and comfortable.",“Online customer service is horrible”
Turkish Airlines,"To start with a a 23 hour flight became 55 hours with Turkish.  We left Bucharest with a delay. It was initially announced as one hour but ended up being closer to two hours. Even though we landed midnight, 35 minutes before the time of departure of my connecting flight to Kuala Lumpur, Turkish staff decided not to give it another 15 minutes to allow the 10-15 people from my flight to catch the connection. I will skip over a highly disorganised process that got us to a hotel past 4am. That was a first night wasted by Turkish staff.  The guy who organised the ticket during the night as well as the person who organised the ticket in the morning failed to get us a ticket all the way to Sydney. They sent us to KL promising that they will fix us there. But when we got to Kuala Lumpur, Turkish don't even have a desk there! These guys just threw a hot potato in someone else's lap! In KL we had to run around for help and wasted another full day. Eventually we found a gate with another Turkish flight and after an hour of waiting, they agreed to take care of us. Their solution was to put us on a low cost flight (remember the $12k we paid) - at this point we just wanted to get back home. When we finally landed in Sydney, our luggage did not follow. Again, Turkish do not have a desk there so we had to find a way. Cutting the story short, our luggage eventually made it to our place on Sunday. Overall a horrible experience. Definitely not worth the money we paid for the ticket. Numerous people involved either did not know what they were doing or intentionally passed us along to get rid of the issue. Even though we flew in July, Turkish are yet to compensate us in any way for it!",Overall a horrible experience
Turkish Airlines,"I was quite disappointed. I traveled round trip NYC to Singapore and have made the same or similar trip on Qatar, Korean, Delta, Singapore, and ANA. Turkish was vastly inferior to the others. On both flights on the way water dripped from above onto the passengers. I got splashed from above when we landed which was extremely unpleasant and other passengers had issues as well. The flight crew responded by crumpling and placing paper towels in the vents which didn’t solve the problem, only created damp paper towels on the floor when they fell out. Worse still, when I used the lavatory after boarding a flight attendant unlocked it from the outside and opened the door when I was on the toilet. I confronted him and he didn’t apologise, only saying he needed to do a head count before takeoff. Grossly unprofessional and inconsiderate. Lastly, the seats were undoubtedly the most uncomfortable of any I’ve experienced on flights over 10 hours. Very cramped especially compared to the Asian airlines and there were boxes (guessing inflight entertainment) on the ground that took away a third of whatever legroom remained. Inflight amenity kits, entertainment, and 2 pieces free luggage are little consolation when you can’t sit in your seat without water dripping on you from above, can’t go to the toilet without flight attendants charging in on you, and can’t even put a small bag under your seat because there isn’t enough room.",I was quite disappointed
Turkish Airlines,"This is my first time flying with Turkish airline and probably my last. Upon arrival at my destination, the luggage was destroyed. Thankfully able to get compensation from my travel insurance as I was not able to get compensation from TA with quite a lot of complicated procedures. On our flight back, they even lose our luggage and check it out at the transiting airport. This caused us unnecessary stress needing to get someone to transfer the luggage back to our final destination. This was despite us emphasising to them at the airport to transfer our luggage to final destination. Food was good but the service can be quite slow and if you sit in the middle row (good luck) you will probably get ignored by the FA from both ends.",service can be quite slow
Turkish Airlines,"Our flights delayed, missed a connecting flight. It's done, no issues as it was on the way home not beginning our holiday. Lucky in some sense but could have been horrible. Istanbul is not Europe, it's not Asia, it's a nice middle ground where our simcards don't work. Majority of people traveling here are transiting, despite that the airport chooses to limit free airport WiFi to only 1 hour. Flight delays and updating our families could happen at anytime, we can't plan it for that one hour when people spend hours at airports, especially if it's delayed. So their solution is to monetize your panic and necessities by have you pay a ridiculous amount for more limited WiFi. Even the staff said this is the only solution. So in panic I buy it, settle my stuff, burned my money, only to realize they do have free WiFi, you just need to key in your flight information under TK WiFi.

Turkish Airlines,"I bought seats for all my family (4 persons), I got requested by Turkish airline to confirm to agree to schedule change (its just 10 mins delay of Istanbul to singapore). I click agree then all my bought seats went scrambled (lost my bought seats). I did feedback forum complaint and uploaded screenshot of my previous email of my bought seats and call the customer service with same answer from Turkish airline. So I had to buy another seat arrangement because they separated our family seats for Istanbul to singapore. Practically forcing me to buy another seats arrangements if i want to seat with my family. I paid 2 times for the same flight for the seats and i had to spent 6-7 times call to their Turkish airline customer service with no solution. They always have the same answer : system shows I only bought 2 seats instead of 4 seats despite the email evidence that prove otherwise. This is the first time for me that a bought paid seats can be cancelled and lost.  Plus when we landed in Istanbul, the flight gate won't show up until 90 mins before flight time and 30 mins before boarding time. As we landed in gate A, we had to hurry up to gate F once the gate showed in the billboard. Practically from one end to the other end. My advise : avoid this airline if possible.",I had to buy another seat arrangement
Turkish Airlines,"I am deeply dissatisfied with my recent experience on Turkish Airlines. Despite paying an additional $39 for specific seat selection (51A and 51B) for a long flight from Istanbul to Miami, my wife and I were not seated together. Instead, my wife was assigned to seat 49A. This is not the first time Turkish Airlines has failed to honor our seat selection. On a previous occasion, they managed to reseat us together, but this time, due to a full flight, they were unable to do so. This resulted in a chaotic scene where security had to intervene and rearrange seating, causing distress among passengers and a delay in takeoff. When I requested a refund for the seat selection fee, given that the service I paid for was not provided, Turkish Airlines refused to acknowledge their mistake. Their customer service was unhelpful and unsympathetic, taking two weeks to respond to my complaint via email (as they do not handle refund requests over the phone), only to deny my request for a refund. This experience has left me feeling frustrated and deceived. In conclusion, the lack of respect for customers, poor service, and refusal to rectify their mistakes has resulted in a terrible customer experience. I would not recommend Turkish Airlines to others based on this experience.",I am deeply dissatisfied
Turkish Airlines,On check in at Istanbul airport we were told by the check In attendant that they were no longer issuing paper boarding passes and we need a Turkish cell number to send the boarding passes to. Well we do not live in Turkey so why would we have a Turkish cell number. The gentleman then said he would speak to the supervisor to issue the paper ones. The supervisor then arrived and screamed at us on the top of her voice. We have never been spoken to like this at a check in counter at any airport in the world. We actually had to ask her to calm down and take a moment to compose herself. A really bad experience that will influence any future decisions when booking flights again.,A really bad experience
Turkish Airlines,"The flight itself was ok, however what I found disappointing is the flight attendant attitude. This is my first time flying with Turkish Airlines and the attendant for the back rows was not smiling, not helpful and looked a bit irritated. I’m sorry for comparing but my experience with other airlines were far more enjoyable. Also, the lavatory was very dirty and it took a while until the attendants clean the lavatory; tissues everywhere on the floor and the sink is very clogged.",disappointing flight attendant attitude
Turkish Airlines,"I fly with Turkish often as it is the only airline my company will validate tickets through and every time I fly with them I remember why I prefer Qatar Airways significantly more. This last flight though was my absolute last straw and I am never flying with them again. I paid 39USD to be able to pick my seat on a two hour flight. When I got to my seat there was a family sitting there and they straight up told me to find another seat. I picked the middle of the plane, 18C, and I picked an aisle seat specifically so I could get back and forth to the bathroom (because unfortunately I am THAT person). I ended up extremely sick and nauseous during the flight and I had to run to the back of the plane for the entire duration of the flight. Flight attendant laughed at me, only help I got was from the two people sitting in my new row. Only way I can describe this is absolutely trashy and messy service from Turkish Airlines in Turkey. Yes it's only 39USD but I paid extra for my seat and it isn't even about that, it's the fact that everybody expected me to give up a seat that I paid for! They didn't plan ahead and book seats all together and that was never my fault.",I am never flying with them again

Middle of October, my return flight from Colombo to Istanbul was cancelled and I was forced to return to Turkey 24 hours earlier than planned. Of course I did not only pay one extra night for the hotel in Sri Lanka that I could not take and also an additional night in Turkey, because the airline forced me to change my flight. Turkish Airlines did not offer me any compensation for this flight cancellation in the EU nor a compensation for the coverage of the additional hotel costs. In late October/early November - more than 2 months after my luggage was lost - Turkish Airlines offered me a compensation of around EUR 250 for the expenses occurred during the time my luggage was lost. Considering that I had to travel for 2 months without a suitcase and I had handed in bills at the sum of around EUR 800 this is not only a joke, but also illegal behavior, as according to the Montreal Agreement.  After involving the Turkish Airlines Vienna Sales Office as well as two customer right organizations, I finally got the confirmation in mid-November, that my full expenses covering around EUR 800 are covered by the airline and I sent my bank details to Turkish Airlines about a day later. On Dec 1 I got a message from the Turkish Airlines Vienna Baggage Service informing me that unfortunately it was not possible yet to do the bank transfer and that the transfer of EUR 755 would be made within 15 working days. I was asked to fill in yet another form (in addition to the many forms and documents I already handed in way earlier), which I did on the same day. Today, 15 working days have fully passed and still there is no compensation on my bank account, despite me trying to call both Turkish Airlines Vienna offices (Nobody picked up the phone.) and sending another email to both the TA Baggage Service and the TA Vienna Sales Office asking for a confirmation/status quo of the transfer about a week ago. This behavior is just the worst service I have ever experienced from any company and airline.",just the worst service
Turkish Airlines,"Our baggage was lost (they somehow left it in Istanbul, it was a connecting flight) After 2 weeks they've delivered our baggage wide open and half empty. After 5 months of calls, emails and case numbers we've received email that no reimbursement whatsoever. This is Unbelievable because 5 months they've assured us that if they don't find our belongings they will pay 500 euros reimbursement. We've called more than 20 times, spend hours on the phone. Turkish Airlines is the worst we've experienced so far. Why on earth they treat customers like that?",the worst we've experienced
Turkish Airlines,"Completely awful! They were 4 hours late, then they had problem boarding and that took another 45 mins. I missed my original connection IST-BKK. The new connection required 6 hours overly. The worst airline in 30 yrs since I have been flying. Avoid this airline at all costs.",“Completely awful!”
Turkish Airlines,"Atlanta to Istanbul, A350 plane seems new, nice and clean. Food was good cabin crew was friendly. Istanbul to Bangkok, 330 plane seems aged and old food and crew was good. Overall experience with flight was great. Ground crew not so much.",“experience with flight was great”
Turkish Airlines,"I thought paying for an airline ticket would save me time and nerves on long trips. It doesn't! The app is terrible, it just forgot to tell me that my ticket was canceled, and there were no explanations or apologies for the cancellation. It was just your flight has been canceled due to operational reasons. This is definitely not what a passenger wants to see when they have everything planned two months in advance.",“no explanations or apologies”
Turkish Airlines,"Istanbul to London (24th November) had delay, so that when me and my wife got to London airport unfortunately we missed the next flight as boarding was closed already. I talked to Turkish Airlines about the issue, they didn't take responsibility. Therefore, staying one day in London and I paid more than 2000 dollars to come back to Toronto.",didn't take responsibility
Turkish Airlines,"I bought my tickets months ago and received tickets number in the official APP, the flight was overbooked and the person in charge refused to issue boarding pass to me. He refused to make compensation to my loss. We are trapped in Havana, no hotel provided. And my hotel in Istanbul cannot cancel to make refund.",refused to issue boarding pass
Turkish Airlines,I have booked my flight for December 2023 2 months in advance but unfortunately I had health issues before travel. I  submitted medical certificate for refund request. Initially they agreed for travel vouchers refund and finally they forced me to cancel ticket and cancelation charges are 70% of booking amount.,cancelation charges are 70% of booking amount
Turkish Airlines,"After their system CRASHED on Nov 1, 2023, dozens of flights were cancelled including ours. Our first flight had a delay of 5 hours also. What happened is that we had to spend a day in Istanbul after waiting in long queues for hours without any information from them. We then made our own arrangements on our expenses to finally get back home the next day as flights back to Greece remained cancelled. I made our claim 17 days ago (we were supposed to have an answer within 7 days, I presumed maximum 14) and today, I couldn’t even find an email address in order to ask for an update. Finally, I managed to get on a call with a customer representative that was one of the rudest people I’ve spoken to (he refused to give me even a high-level timeframe that I could expect to receive an update from them) by saying I cannot give you a date, because anything I’ll tell you it will make me a liar. How is this man called a professional and speaks with passengers that got through horrific circumstances, spend thousands of euros on their flight and they are treated this way? We will see if they will ever reimburse for the flights they cancelled.",one of the rudest people I’ve spoken to
Turkish Airlines,"We were denied boarding on a Turkish Airlines flight from Istanbul to Tashkent, because we asked a question of the gate agent. Afterward, we were sent from one customer service desk to another, and every time they refused to rebook our flight because they said we did not arrive at the gate in time to board. Another customer service agent told us that “we refused to board the plane”, therefore it was our own fault. We had to spend an additional four thousand dollars just to get out of Turkey and continue on our trip. Our return flights back to the United States were also significantly impacted, resulting in more additional expenses. To make the trip even worse, our luggage was lost and we did not get it back until the end of the trip. Turkish Airlines refused to give us a refund or admit any wrongdoing related to their atrocious customer service, even though we submitted copies of our stamped boarding passes verifying that we were at the gate in plenty of time to board! We will never fly Turkish Airlines again!",said we did not arrive at the gate in time
Turkish Airlines,"I booked a flight from Amsterdam to Aqaba with a stop in Istanbul. Because the first flight was delayed I missed my transfer in Istanbul. I told the crew I would miss my next flight and they said they would arrange for me (and some other passengers) to be picked up by ground stewards and taken quickly to the next flight and that they would wait for us. When we got off the plane, of course no one was waiting for us. The first flight that went to Aqaba was the next day. I had to wait on the airport the whole night and couldn't sleep for more than 24 hours because they said there was no time to book a hotel. They gave me a coupon for food but there was not any restaurant who accepted the coupon. I had to pay for the food and for the wifi to check my next flight, who was also delayed. I arrived one day later on my destination and missed the first day of my only 5 day trip because of this and they will not pay me any compensation because they say the reason of the delay was out of their control. However they will not tell me the reason of the delay. The service of cheaper airlines I traveled with, is much, much better than the service of Turkish Airlines, where you pay double for the same tickets.",they will not tell me the reason of the delay
Turkish Airlines,"I had to take this flight because Turkish Airline has cancelled the flight Cluj-Istanbul (due to bad weather although all the other planes flew to different cities in Europe). After paying a fortune in taxi fares from Cluj to Bucharest, the flight TK 1046 from Bucharest (that supposed to arrive in Istanbul) at the same time as the flight from Cluj took off 35 min late. Because Turkish airline did not close the cancelled flight from Cluj, I could not have the Boarding Pass for my next flight TK 70 from Istanbul to Hong Kong, let alone the Boarding Pass From Hong Kong to Sydney. Due to all these issues and the fact that at Istanbul's Transit Desk were hundreds of other passengers with flights messed up, I could not make the connecting flight to Hong Kong. When I finally managed to arrive in front of a person, I arrogantly had been told that I need to purchase another ticket because it was my fault I took the flight from Bucharest to Istanbul. Of course I told them I did this in order to make the connecting flight, yet it seems that I was talking to a wall. After 2 hours at that desk (in that time there must have been more than 500 distraught Turkish Airline customers) I bought another ticket, this time with the beloved Qatar Airways. The story is much longer, I had to retrieve my luggage, pay for a Turkish visa, take a bus to SAW airport all on my own time and expense. After many days of sending a request (with all the supporting documents (including an screen shot of the other flights from Cluj that flew very well to all Europe and beyond); a refund from Turkish Airline has not been granted, neither an apology given. In all it was my fault I took Turkish Airline. No worries, it will never happen again.",seems that I was talking to a wall
Turkish Airlines,"Istanbul to Montreal on Turkish Airlines. As I connected from a domestic flight I went straight to the TK lounge which offered a wide array of food and beverages with ample seating and relaxation options. Boarding started one hour prior to take-off and, as with all TK flights, was chaotic and lacked proper handling by the gate agents. I was shocked to see that they did not bother to match my passport to my boarding pass. Onboard, the hard product was new and a welcome improvement in terms of privacy and aisle access. However, the seats are quite challenging to get in and out of and would pose a problem for passengers with a larger build. Following take-off we were given a drink menu and told that there would be no food menu and that we would be given an option to choose a main course only. When lunch was served, they simply brought a pre-plated tray with appetizer and dessert and no salad option. Unlike previous experiences on TK, there was no appetizer or dessert trolley and no soup offering. The catering was a significant downgrade from the standard TK had previously established and won accolades for. The food quality and taste was at best OK but drink options were good with champagne on offer. The seat was comfortable and offered lots of storage options but inability to set the foot and back rest to individual settings took some getting used to. IFE had plenty to choose from with the latest movies and music in their library. FA’s were quite attentive and went about their business with calm and poise instead of the frantic running around I had observed on several other flights. The flight took off slightly behind schedule but landed on time. The overall experience was OK but the downgrade in catering was a total disappointment. I would look at other carriers on this route as TK seems to have abandoned its distinguishing practice of top notch catering.",catering was a total disappointment
Turkish Airlines,"I took 4 flights on Turkish Airlines in a 10 day span, Miami-Istanbul, Istanbul-Dubai, Dubai-Istanbul and Istanbul-Miami. The only decent flight was the first one from Miami to Istanbul and from there every single flight was a nightmare, from the flights being delayed to the rude people working on these flights. From Istanbul to Miami  had a flight attendant that was super rude to the point that I asked him for a water and he wouldn’t even look at me and just walk away,  that I had to go back to the place where they have the food and water and I had to ask him in bad way (are you ever going to give me the water I asked you for?). I would never fly again with them. The plane from Istanbul to Dubai and the plane Istanbul to Miami looked outdated and tired inside with the seats looking old and color faded and the entertainment system outdated as well.",I would never fly again with them
Turkish Airlines,"Ankara to Istanbul on Turkish Airlines. Checked in using the counter at the entrance to the domestic business lounge. The agent was courteous and efficient. I inquired about catching the earlier flight as mine was already showing a one-hour delay. He put me on standby which eventually came through. On board the business class configuration was the same as European carriers with the seats the same as economy with the middle seat left empty. The seat width and pitch were narrow bordering on uncomfortable. After an on-time departure, we were served a hot breakfast which is a welcome surprise for a 45 minute flight. I opted for coffee instead only to be told they had adjusted their catering and would not serve coffee on domestic flights. Instead, I was offered tea. Whilst it did not matter for such a short flight, I found it absurd that they would not serve coffee but tea. I even pointed out the menu we were given which clearly showed coffee on offer. The flight landed on time and was otherwise uneventful.",“would not serve coffee on domestic flights”
Turkish Airlines,"Montreal to Istanbul on Turkish Airlines. 72 hours before the flight I received notice of an aircraft change which resulted in my advanced seat selection becoming useless as I ended up in a window seat with a neighbour instead of a direct aisle access seat. I tried resolving the matter by talking to their call centre which proved to be futile and a giant waste of time. Check-in was smooth and handled by a very pleasant agent. I used the Air Canada Maple Leaf Lounge prior to boarding which was well equipped with several food and beverage choices with some made to order. On board, the hard product looked worn and tired. The seat cushions were worn out and made it uncomfortable especially in the lie-flat position. The configuration on the A330 offers almost no privacy and has limited space for stuff you would want to keep within reach. We were served drinks and a hot meal shortly after take off. Food and beverage quality was good but I noticed a downgrade in the usual TK inflight offering I had come to expect. There was no appetizer or dessert trolley resulting in a single choice. Bathrooms were kept clean but as with every TK flight, the cabin temperature was uncomfortably warm. The FA’s were very friendly and accommodating and worked very hard throughout the flight. Two hours before landing a full hot breakfast was served but I opted for coffee only. The IFE had a wide selection with recent movies and music. Flight left late but landed slightly behind schedule. Overall, the onboard experience was favourable but the call centre was an utter disaster.",the hard product looked worn and tired
Turkish Airlines,TK209 was operated using the A350 on 28 October 2023. The aircraft had a 1-2-1 configuration with each seat in an enclosed suite with privacy door. Catering was superb with flying chef service. Wifi connectivity was fast and good with 1GB of data for up to 2 devices. The seat was full flat reclinable. Ferragamo toiletries were given out and Denon noise cancelling headphones were provided. Overall the flight was good. Flight attendants were efficient and polite. However I felt that they were in a hurry to clear the trays after meal service.,Catering was superb
Turkish Airlines,"My recent experience with Turkish Airlines has been extremely disappointing. I used to be a loyal customer, but my recent flights have been nothing short of a nightmare. The flight from Prishtina to Istanbul was delayed for hours, from 8:25 pm to 11:50 pm, with no communication or updates provided. To make matters worse, the flight from Istanbul to Doha was abruptly canceled, leaving passengers in complete darkness with zero information. Upon reaching the airport, I was greeted by an outrageously long queue. While Turkish Airlines did arrange a hotel for us, it was located two hours away from the airport. By the time we were able to check in, it was already 6 in the morning. My rescheduled flight for today at 8:45 pm has been subject to continuous delays, and I am currently stranded at the airport with no information or assistance. Even my attempts to seek help at the Turkish Airlines care point were futile due to the never-ending queue. This entire experience has been a nightmare, and I have never felt so let down by an airline. I can confidently say that I will never choose to fly with Turkish Airlines again. This level of irresponsibility and lack of communication is simply unacceptable. It's been a horrible ordeal that I wouldn't wish on anyone.",It's been a horrible ordeal
Turkish Airlines,"When I arrived in Istanbul from the US my connecting flight to Bucharest had been cancelled. I was given no information in the email/text message about what to do so had to wander around the Istanbul airport international arrivals hall looking for a service desk. When I found it, it was chaos, frustrated customers yelling, TA employees yelling back, no clear lines, no communication, nothing. They had cancelled so many flights to different destinations and left people stranded. Spent over three hours at customer service only to be finally told that they couldn't get me to Bucharest (an hour flight) until the following night (I had arrived in Istanbul at around 9am). Total mess that screwed up an entire itinerary since Bucharest was not my final destination in Romania. Their hospitality consisted of putting out a box of cheese sandwiches and some water. I didn't even get that because by the time I was out of the customer service line all the food and water were gone and God forbid they put out more than one box. Finally I cancelled the connecting flight to Bucharest and booked a bus there from Istanbul. When I told the customer service person to forget the flight to Bucharest, I was taking a bus, he told me that I would not be able to use my return tickets to the US if I cancelled the flight to Bucharest. I argued with him, he asked what passport I was flying on, I said I was American and gave him my US passport and he magically changed his mind and told me I could still have my return flights. Then it took over two hours to find my luggage, this was after I stood in line for about an hour to talk to someone at baggage claim. Other people at baggage claim who had also been stranded were just walking out of the airport without their bags completely exhausted and ticked off. Some of them had been there for hours. It was not just me, passengers were talking to one another and we were all having a miserable experience. The best part? After all of this I found out that Tarom Airlines had seats available from Istanbul to Bucharest that night and it was the same flight as a TA flight. Why they could not put me on that flight I will never understand. My return flight to the US from Istanbul (I flew back to Istanbul from Bucharest on a Friday evening and flew back to the US Sunday afternoon so I could have a one day stopover) was delayed by four hours which meant I got to the US at around 11pm instead of 7pm. Wound up taking a $100 taxi ride home because public transit from the airport stops at midnight on Sunday where I live. Once again, hospitality involved a cheese sandwich and a bottle of water which they gave out when the plane was boarding. No food voucher for the Istanbul airport where I had to wait for seven hours since I arrived three hours early to check in (the email/text message about the flight delay was sent when I was already in the taxi on my way to the airport). Apparently I was supposed to wait to eat until I was in line to board. Now I am going in circles trying to get a refund for the flight. I can't even find out how much the flight cost since I bought all four of my flights at the same time and there is just a lump sum on the receipt. Called customer service and was told to fill out an online feedback form which requires a ticket number to submit.",trying to get a refund for the flight
Turkish Airlines,Basically one of the WORST airlines I have ever flown with. They over-sell seats on a regular basis. I arrived at the check-in counter only to be told that me and my wife were not guaranteed of seats as the flight was over-booked. They asked us to go to the departure gate and wait at the counter to see if the staff could there could give us seats. If not we were to be given ‘some money’ and put on the next available flight. The staff were treating Caucasians differently from Indians with regard to seat service. The flight from Cappadocia was delayed by one hour and that almost made us miss our connecting flight to Malaysia.,They over-sell seats on a regular basis
Turkish Airlines,We were flying from Heathrow to Singapore via Istanbul (what a mistake). Our flight from Heathrow was delayed for three hours so we missed our connection to Singapore. After alighting the aircraft we received no help at all. We were sent from desk to desk in a very very large airport. All Turkish Airline staff were extremely rude and just snarled at us. It was only with the help of a younger passenger that we found a Care Desk (not correctly named). We lined up for an hour and two new boarding passes were thrown at us for a flight at 5pm the next day. We were told to go to the Hotel Desk. No signage at all. We found the desk and queued for another hour to be seen. We are both in our late seventies so this was really troubling to us. We then had to wait for another hour for all passengers to be seen and queued for a coach. The coach then took us for a two hour journey to a hotel. When we arrived we had to queue for another hour to be booked in. By this time it was 6.30am. We only had time for a quick breakfast and a short nap to then be transported back to Istanbul Airport in what was a converted Transit Van. The flight to Singapore was further delayed for another hour. All in all it took us 40 hours to reach Singapore a journey that was supposed to take 15 hours. We have subsequently cancelled our return flight with this terrible airline and have booked at considerable expense on a Singapore Airlines flight. As mentioned before we are both in our seventies and could not risk a repeat of the outward journey. Do not be fooled by the competitive prices this airline charges. You only get what you pay for especially where airlines are concerned.,“staff were extremely rude”
Turkish Airlines,"The business class is always outstanding compared to European and even Japanese Airlines. The food selection and quality is way better than on other carriers. The welcome drinks, alcoholic and non alcoholic are already special and distinctive. The cabin crew was very kind and professional. The seat is changed into close to a bed, with a comfortable topper. The entertainment selection was very international and good. Wi-Fi is for free unlike at most other airlines.",always outstanding
Turkish Airlines,"Horrible company! Don't fly with them, their customer support is horrible, no one can do a anything and no one is responsible for anything.

They lost our bags in Istanbul during our layover despite them being booked direct through to Dubai. We are now sitting on our honeymoon supposed to exploring and having a romantic time eating out so I can spoil my wife, instead we are stuck inside without clothes. You cannot even reach this company to try and locate your bags, our information is entered incorrectly on their system, and our one bag we cannot even locate through them. Do not trust this company at all. You will be disappointed. I expect this company to compensate me for all the clothes I will have to buy and for the inconvenience.",They lost our bags in Istanbul

I spent about 12 hours at Istanbul airport with no sign of a transfer on the cards, even after i was told 3hrs into my wait that id be able to catch another flight in 4 hours.

Turkish Airlines,"Worst experience ever with an airline. Our first flight was delayed 50 minutes, so we missed our connection and had to be rerouted. We arrived 15 hours late to our destination and our luggage arrived 3 days later. On the return flight, we missed our connection. We knew in advance that it was going to be an issue because Turkish Airlines changes the flight time’s leaving only a 30 minute window between flights. Although the change was on their itinerary, they would not change our flights without exorbitant fees until after we missed our connection. This left us stranded in the Istanbul airport for 24 hours. They paid for nothing and didn’t even apologize for the delays. Literally the worst customer service experience. They lied constantly throughout the process to get us to someone else’s desk.

Turkish Airlines,"The worst customer service I have received from an airline. Our flight got delayed from Madrid to Istanbul for final destination to Miami. We had the Miami boarding passes already. We ran to the gate and it closed 10 min before without waiting for the already there passengers, not even 10 more minutes to prevent the chaos. The customer service that takes care of this issues is awful and unprofessional, giving the wrong information and lack of directions making the experience more miserable. They didn’t tell us that we needed a Turkish Visa for US Citizens to exit the airport for Hotel Services. It was 3 am, the hotel was one hour away and then we needed to come back 4 hours later for the next flight at 2 pm, it makes no sense at all. We couldn’t get our luggage because was already checked in for the next flight. On top of that, we paid hundreds of dollars for assigned front seats 5 months ago which were not honored for the new flight to Chicago for final destination to Miami (flying with United Airlines with No seats assigned). So, our dreamed trip got downgraded for a delay on a connecting flight. We got row 42 for the new flight as the best effort. First and last trip with this airline that do not care at all about their passengers.",The worst customer service

Finally the cheapest of cheap of hotels with bus trip there, further 20 minutes wait. Around 11pm at the hotel, with two kids and told to be back at the airport following morning at 6:50am 3hours before departure. Never again. Had a cancellation with Easy jet last month.

Are you kidding me, when you flew on business class, costing thousands of USD. The lie flat seat malfunctioned at the middle of the flight and there was nothing done to change to another seat as all other business seats were occupied. Told to send email and file complains to Turkish Airlines later. I did file a complain on the business lie flat sleeper seat with the airline, offered 15% discount on future travel before year end 2023. That is it, flight discount on Turkish Airlines.

I'm 78 years old and collected hundreds of flights during my life. With my age, I've walking problems and, considering the considerable distance between arrival and departure gates in Istanbul airport, we asked Turkish Airlines to have a transportation help at the airport, a wheelchair or other solutions. To make sure of its availability, we called Turkish Airlines three times from the hotel we were staying in Cyprus four, three and two days before leaving, then we asked again in Ercan airport when we checked in for the first fly, all of them confirming the availability of the transportation. When we arrived at Istanbul airport, we didn't find any transportation help. We asked again, but nothing happened. Being short the time before departure, I decided to walk: 72 minute fast walking to join the departure gate. When I arrived I was really in very bad condition! We will never fly again with Turkish Airlines and we would recommend all those people with physical problems to avoid this unreliable company.",experienced the worst airline customer care

However, no reasonable effort was made to find a non-emergency bulk head seat by switching passengers to her lost seat (emergency row).  We flew Turkish before Covid and had decent service.

Cabin service was ok, tasty food and drinks. Only music was available as entertainment, no Wi-Fi onboard.",tasty food and drinks
Turkish Airlines,"Flight was right on time, boarding in Biskek chaotic - no business class priority. Cabin crew friendly, good food with Appetizer and main course (3 choices). Free Wi-Fi on board, entertainment system with new release movies. Good job Turkish Airlines!",“Cabin crew friendly”
Turkish Airlines,"I pre-booked my seats for both flights but we were informed that our pre-booked seats for our flight from Istanbul to Heathrow had been allocated to someone else and that the flight had been overbooked and that there may be no seats for us on the flight. However there was no clear explanations or communications and were left waiting at a check in desk, with a 7 year old sitting on floors whilst the check in staff and supervisors desperately tried to resolve the situation. I must say the staff all tried their best, however there was a lack of communication, nobody really knew what was happening and nobody could explain anything to us. Eventually with around 40 minutes until our flight took off we were handed boarding passes with the seat numbers left blank, told to board our flight to Istanbul and once we arrived at Istanbul we would have 3 options which were: There would be seats available and allocated to us or There would not be seats available in which case we would be put on the next available flight and compensated Or there would not be seats available, if the next available flight was not until the next day we would be compensated and accommodated in a hotel overnight. We were then told that our flight from Izmir was delayed. When we landed at Istanbul we had to run to the International transfers and by the time we arrived there I saw I had received a text message that my flight had changed to a flight the next day which would have been sent before we had even landed. At the desk we were informed that seats were found for us on the original flight, however we had missed the flight due to the delayed flight from Izmir. I know that the flight to Heathrow was delayed and was still on the ground and boarding at the time - and we were told in Izmir that the only seat available on the flight was 1 seat in business class. We were automatically changed onto a flight at 14:50 on 27th August. The seats we were given were 6B, 6C and 13A which meant my daughter couldn’t have a window seat and my husband had to spend the flight separated from us. We were then directed to the Turkish Airlines Hotel desk to arrange for overnight accommodation. When we finally reached the desk we then had to wait a further hour or so before we were transported to our accommodation. During which time my daughter was now hungry and tired. I had no choice but to buy food for her.  We were then transported to the Ibis Istanbul airport, and on arrival all I can describe the scene as is carnage. There was no method, no order, nothing, just names randomly called out. The time now was past 10pm. By the time we were allocated a room and were able to get food it was gone 11pm. The next day we were given breakfast at the hotel, however had to buy lunch. To date Turkish airlines have refused to accept responsibility, and even acknowledge the overbooking of the flight and the forced 'bumping' of our seats. They are refusing to pay us compensation for the delay or the bumping of our seats and continuously give different excuses to validate the delay to avoid paying compensation. Absolutely disgraceful customer service from Turkish airlines.",disgraceful customer service
Turkish Airlines,"I am really dissatisfied with the Turkish Airlines claim department. I came back from a trip on 7/25/23. My luggage came in late which wouldn't be a problem but I received my luggage completely damaged. I filed the claim right after I received my luggage. It's been already 2 months and I never heard back from the claim department. I have been calling every single day and the customer service representative keeps telling me that they put in urgent requests about it but I am still not getting updates. I am traveling again and I need a new suitcase but I still didn't receive my refund from Turkish Airlines. This happened to me with Lufthansa and they solved my problem in 2 weeks and I received a refund right away. I am going to keep calling every day until I get my refund back. Shame on you Turkish airlines, I know now that I will never travel with them again.",Shame on you Turkish airlines
Turkish Airlines,"I arrived in Istanbul from Ghana on 16th September 2023 with my wife for our wedding anniversary and to tour the country. But the experience has been very disappointing with Turkish Airlines not being able to promptly address my concerns about my luggage which did not arrive with me in Istanbul. After making a complaint with Turkish baggage service center in Istanbul, I was told my luggage never left Kotoka Airport in Accra. It’s been three days and I’ve still not gotten my luggage.",I’ve still not gotten my luggage

Turkish Airlines,"Upon arrival at the airport for our trip from Brussels to Yogjakarta (Indonesia) it appeared that our flight was cancelled at the latest moment. We were told that a birdstrike was the cause but this is very questionable. After a waiting time of 8 hours at the airport in Brussels, Turkish Airlines were finally able to give us another route to Jakarta but not until our final destination of Yogjakarta. This forced us to book a hotel in Jakarta and a new flight to Yogjakarta. In the end we arrived 24 hours later at our destination Yogjakarta than originally foreseen. After our trip, we tried to claim the additional cost of €400 we had to pay ourselves (hotel cost + new flight cost to Yogjakarta). Despite being able to give all necessary documentation, Turkish Airlines refused to refund. We lost a full day of our trip but the airline was not able to give the little compensation we were asking. We will not be flying with Turkish Airlines anymore!",Turkish Airlines refused to refund

Turkish Airlines,"I would like to file a complaint regarding my recent experience with Turkish Airlines due to their subpar service. Before embarking on my long-haul flight, I attempted to contact their customer service at to inquire about making changes. Regrettably, reaching them was quite challenging, and I endured a frustrating half-hour hold time without receiving any assistance. When it was time for my family and me to board our flight from Barcelona to Singapore, Turkish Airlines inexplicably separated us. Despite having booked our seats together as three passengers, we found ourselves scattered apart. Naturally, we voiced our discontent, as it's unreasonable to split a family on such a lengthy journey, especially after reserving specific seats. Adding to the frustration, the airline sent me numerous confusing emails with 5 days before my flight, suggesting that my seats reservation had been refunded. These emails were unclear and seemed to be plagued by technical issues, causing further anxiety and uncertainty. Furthermore, I must highlight that the customer service assistants, both in Barcelona and Istanbul, were notably rude and appeared to lack proper training. Their unhelpful demeanor and lack of responsiveness further compounded our dissatisfaction with the airline's service. It was evident that they were ill-prepared to provide the level of service one would expect from a reputable airline, leaving us with a disappointing overall experience. Upon boarding the flight, the only solution I found was to negotiate with another passenger who had been assigned the seat my wife should have been assigned. Thankfully, this person agreed to switch seats, but this situation was far from ideal. Considering that Turkish Airlines is part of the Star Alliance group, this level of service is unacceptable. I cannot recommend Turkish Airlines to others based on my experience, and I have no intention of using this airline in the future.",disappointing overall experience
Turkish Airlines,"Absolutely appalled at the quality of the website and worse off, the service. Prior to the flight 2 days ago, I purchased a window seat. When checking in online, I realized that it’s been automatically switched to a different seat altogether, an aisle one. When I called into support to remedy it, I was told that the seat that I purchased has been taken up, this happens quite often. Whilst I accept that sometimes issues happen, the service by Turkish airlines made it much worse. After being told that it happens quite often, I was told the only way to remedy it is to 1. Write a feedback form with the screenshot of the payment (I don’t know why, she could see it in the system down the the exact seat I bought) 2. Wait to get the support ticket number via email 3. Call back into support with the ticket number so that they can help me try to get the seat back. What?! Why must I submit a ticket to get a new support ticket number, then call back to give the support number? Why can’t she help me straight away. After calling this out, I was then told *i” was the one who made the mistake because I checked in online when I’ve bought a seat. Thank you, I did not know that Turkish airlines website is from 1980s and I did not know I’m not supposed to check in online when I’ve purchased a seat. Absolutely gobsmacked. Oh, and I was told to be at the airport 3hrs early to fix this. Third class airline.",Third class airline
Turkish Airlines,"Our flight has a 3hrs delay so we lost our corresponding flight and we were waiting for more 5hrs for our corresponding flight. In total 8hrs and as they apply the Turkish law they refuse any compensation. The agents in Istanbul hardly speak English and are rude when the whole flight was expecting to change their boarding pass for the next available flight. Bad customer service and overall customer experience. I do not recommend it, and I will avoid any future flight with Turkish Airlines. I cannot even understand why they are member of Star Alliance when they do not speak English.",Bad customer service
Turkish Airlines,"I would never consider using Turkish Airlines again, we had a pretty miserable experience with TK. Our roundtrip to Singapore it has been just a continuous annoying trip: our 4 flights were delayed, very crampy seats even on the new A350. Kids menu never arrived even if it was booked a lot before the departure date and the new IST Airport is just a massive shopping mall with atrocious prices with very long walk from gate to gate; connection flights are displayed just 30 minutes before boarding so you have to literally run throughout the airport to find your gate.",a pretty miserable experience
Turkish Airlines,"Awful customer service. Several delays without notice or apology. They didn't bother when I asked the reason why the flight delayed. Chief of cabin crew said This is not a bus for you, flights usually delay, if you don't like this never come to Turkish Airlines. What a reply from an unprofessional, untrained and illiterate staff. Definitely not buying a ticket from Turkish Airlines again.",“Awful customer service”

Turkish Airlines,"I have flow with Turkish Airlines transatlantic several times – flights were on time, flight attendants were courteous, entertainment was fine and food served was of high quality. Yet, as some of you know one negative personal experience could turn your favorable impression of a company upside-down. What happened is that I booked a flight from Boston to Istanbul October 2022. The fight was supposed to leave the night of December 25. I learnt that flight had been cancelled only upon arriving to the airport (no prior email!) – TA counter was deserted and there was no one to talk to. I called TA customer service the next morning but their response to my plight was callous and they made no effort to find me an alternative flight. I asked TA for a refund, but my request was starkly denied! Furthermore, responding to a dispute, I submitted to my credit card company, TA argued that I am the one who was at fault, because I had not shown-up for the flight! Only in mid-March, thanks to the help of Dept. of Transportation, TA agreed to refund me after I fill out a form. Yet, this was not the end of it. I was expecting the refund to arrive by end April- nothing! It took many more emails and numerous phone calls until I was finally reimbursed by the end of June 2023. My dealing with Turkish Airlines customer service was awful: Their main goal is not to serve customers (things happen), but to wear you down until average Joe gives up. Learn from my experience.",Turkish Airlines customer service was awful
Turkish Airlines,"I have travelled all over the world but my trip last week with Turkish Airlines was truly awful. This was a special family trip and we spent a lot of money on business flights. We arrived at Singapore airport in September 2023 to note a flight delay. I explained that  we would not get on the flight unless we were reassured that we would not have problems with our connection from Istanbul to London.  We were told by Turkish airlines ground staff not to worry. If we missed our connection there were seats on the next flight  just 2 hours later and we and our luggage would be reassigned. On the basis of this reassurance we got on the flight. We arrived from Singapore in Istanbul at 6.15pm, late. There was no explanation or apology at any point. We missed our connecting flight as a result. Ground staff have no ability to find a new flight it seems.  The flight that we were meant to be reassigned to does not have any seats and never seemingly did. We ourselves find flights from another airport using Google.  It takes over 2 hours and much frustration to sort out new flights. We are asked to sign waiver forms in order to be provided with our new tickets. We refuse and have to demand that the tickets be printed and handed over. Our new flight is the next day from the other side of Istanbul.  Now for luggage, which we need to collect.  Scenes of chaos greet us when getting luggage.  We arrive to find very many people waiting. About 30 at least.  We had been told that our luggage would be waiting for us (they claim to have called). It takes over another hour to get our luggage which has in part been lost for a period.  Again we are asked to sign forms.  We refuse.    Then we need to get a hotel sorted. Again we are told that this would be easy. It’s not. There is a queue of about 40 people. Another wait and very slow.   We then spent an hour in a shuttle bus to our hotel.   We arrived at the hotel at midnight.  This has taken 6 hours since landing. Having been told that the hotel would be in Central Istanbul. It is clearly not but instead it’s near the other airport. There’s a stray dog in the hotel lobby. Our flight the next day to London is also delayed by almost 2 hours.  We arrive eventually in London after 6.00 pm London time. Total trip time from Singapore to London 41 hours.",my trip last week was truly awful
Turkish Airlines,"They allow 60 minutes for a connecting flight in the Istanbul Airport, which the means the baggage can be lost or delayed as in my case, the baggage tracing is miserable, no one answers the phone.  There was a flight the same day, a few hours later, but I have still not received my luggage 24 hours after arrival. The airline is a disgrace.",still not received my luggage

Turkish Airlines,"We missed our connection to Istanbul because the plane arrived at the gate too late and the journey between gate A and gate F where we were to take our second flight is the furthest in the airport with the addition of passage to again, to safety. We came running to the gate and they closed the plane door in front of us. The plane remained after 20 minutes on the tarmac without moving! We went straight to the office so we could catch another flight. Not only, supposedly, no more flights possible on the same day but only two days later! The only possible flight on the same day that we could take was in business class which we had to pay for without any possible compensation even though I am a platinum member with Star Alliance! A shame! And what's more, our screens didn't work during the flight! Avoid this airline at all costs!",Avoid this airline at all costs
Turkish Airlines,"Very poor experience with Turkish Airlines. Not even possible to choose your own seat for free. You need to pay extra €20/person per leg to choose your seat. Both flights were delayed. The first one (to Bali) 2 hours, the second one (to Malaga) 5 hours. We were told no compensation would be provided. We received a very poor sandwich and warm soft drinks at the gate as only compensation for 5 hours of delay. Insane that not even airport vouchers are provided on a €1500 flight. Overall very poor experience from what I thought to be one of the better airlines.",Overall very poor experience
Turkish Airlines,"As someone who has been a loyal Turkish Airlines customer for a considerable time i recently accumulated around 50,000 Miles and Smiles points. i was excited to use these points to book a flight and maybe even upgrade my seats. However, my experience with the Miles and Smiles program has been incredibly frustrating. According to the Turkish Airlines app and website, members should be able to use their points to purchase tickets or reduce the cost. I attempted to do this multiple times online, but each time we reached the final step, an error message appeared, directing me to contact customer service. I followed the instructions and visited a Turkish Airlines sales office in Dubai, where i was told that i needed 65,000 points to use them for ticket purchases. This contradicted the information available online. Additionally, when i asked to at least use my points to book seats, I was told it wasn't possible at the office. I called the provided number for assistance, but after waiting for over 30 minutes, i received no help and were advised to contact the website help department. This inconsistency in information and lack of support has left me disappointed and questioning the transparency of the Miles and Smiles program. I feel frustrated and let down by Turkish Airlines' customer service. I hope Turkish Airlines can address these issues promptly and ensure that the program's terms and conditions are clear and consistent both online and in their offices. I love flying with Turkish Airlines and want to continue doing so, but these recent experiences have left me with doubts.",feel frustrated and let down

Then I went to airport and checked in and when I was about to enter the flight but the staff couldn’t find my name. It took a while to enter the flight. I asked them a couple of times to make it sure my baggage is in the plane. They confirmed it was in it. However, my baggage was lost. It caused such a stress and change of plans. I called THY almost every day to follow up and change my return flight and receive a refund. However, no positive response yet.

Airport floor staff is well trained to not help you. I have tried to check in to my flight 48 hours prior and the response is we are currently down, call customer service and then customer service will contact you and the run around continues.

We had to wait for another 14 hours in the airport to get a new connection flight, they did not provide us any hotel stay as compensation, only a meal at one of the 5 outlets (we had a burger as a meal!). I started my flight on Wednesday, and reached my destination on Friday, though my transit flight was supposed to be only 9 hours in total. Overall, I was extremely surprised on the rudeness and lack of minimal customer service provided by all their staff, at all levels. Staff are very rude, and they do not even smile or look at your face while talking! As if they are doing you a favor. All employees were very rude, with very poor communication/customer service skills. Never ever again I would book with this airline.",employees were very rude

Only after hours of literal begging we got a ticket for a flight that landed 12 hours later than planned, with lost of money for no show at our hotel. Flying back our flight cancelled and after 2 hours of poor communication we have been sent to a 4 hours line at ticket office. Ground staff in Tbilisi was overwhelmed and not helpful or empathetic.

Turkish Airlines,"We flew with Turkish Airlines from DXB to Madrid. It was the worst overall travel experience. We were delayed 3 hours, This delay not only disrupted our travel plans but also caused us to miss important connecting flight and commitments upon arrival at our final destination of Madrid. Throughout the duration of the delay, there was a distinct lack of communication from the airline regarding the reasons behind the delay and the expected departure time. Passengers were left uninformed and anxious when most if not all had connecting flights. There was no clear information provided by staff. Additionally, when passengers inquired about the status of the flight at airport and on the flight, the staff exhibited lack of professionalism by saying nothing, and lack of concern for our well-being. Also once boarded, at no point did captain or cabin crew make an announcement apologising for the long delay and advise what to do when we all landed in Istanbul for our connecting flights. Upon arrival to Istanbul, again there was a distinct lack of communication or compassion from the airline staff informing the procedure to passengers on what to do and where to go within the airport to reschedule our failed connection flights. Everyone was left in a panic. Staff at Istanbul were unhelpful. Eventually when we all arrived at a desk to reschedule the missed connection flight, new tickets were issued, and we had to sprint as fast as we could through the airport to the gate for boarding. It was all a mad rush! While checking in for the return flight, we were flabbergasted when Turkish Airlines website advised our flight had changed, did we want to cancel or rebook. We called Turkish Airlines in Madrid several times, nobody answered, we sent several WhatsApp messages through the Smart App, and it wasn't surprising that Turkish Airlines never once replied to any of our messages. From Madrid Airport to when we landed in Istanbul we had literally to scramble and run so fast from one end of the airport to the other end to make the boarding. The onboard food services were inadequate. This lack of attention to the quality of onboard services further contributed to a negative overall travel experience.",worst overall travel experience
Turkish Airlines,"Departure in Brussels was delayed, something which is not uncommon with Turkish Airlines and as a result we were going to miss our connecting flight. Luckily, the connecting flight was also delayed so we had approximately 30-45min from landing to reach the gate and still get our connecting flight. However, rather than helping us to reach the connection flight in time, Turkish Airlines delayed our de-boarding from the aircraft and when we could finally step out of the aircraft we were brought with a bus to the gate at the exact opposite of where our connecting flight was departing from. Requests for assistance were made and while all of this happened in Istanbul (home base of Turkish Airlines), nothing was done or even suggested to help with the result that we missed our connecting flight with 10 minutes. Following this the difficulties started to get a new flight for which we had to wait 24 hours, a hotel was luckily provided but by the time we arrived in the hotel it was 6am another 4 hours later.

We were told that were were covered under the passenger rights so we would be compensated for the inconvenience. After being downgraded for one section and having to pay to spend an extra night in our hotel and over 5 hours on the phone to Turkish Airlines Customer Service we had a solution that would take us almost three times as long to get home, but we had an option. Come the day of flight our ticket was downgraded and we were being asked to pay extra to fly in the class we had paid in full for already. After 2.5h of pleading with the ticket office at Antalya the manager did the right thing and got us into the last two remaining seats on the second leg in our original class. Once we put in the claims for compensation as instructed by Customer service, under EU passenger rights, we were informed that the airlines does not need to pay us anything as they send us an SMS over 14 Days before alerting us of the canceled leg. No SMS was received. The only confirmed evidence of us being notified was the day we flew out while we were in the air. TK customer service suggestion was to request to cancel our return flight and find our own way back.",No SMS was received
Turkish Airlines,"The meal I was served  on board left a lot to be desired, I couldn't choose on the return flight but had to take only what they had available. They did not give me the boarding pass even though I sent them an email in this regard. They told me that it is not necessary and that I will solve it at the airport!",did not give me the boarding pass
Turkish Airlines,"Worst airline experience ever. Always delayed, don't rearrange flights until you land, and may not offer a next flight, can be delayed several days. Customer service is poor, staff barely speak English and have poor manners. Istanbul airport is a mess, staff don't speak English, huge airport that is difficult to navigate. They don't honor the seats you pay for on the airplane. Never flying again.",don't honor the seats you pay for
Turkish Airlines,"Turkish Airlines has changed since the first time I flew them in 2013. The legroom on both flights were not good enough for such a long haul flight. The first leg was a Boeing 777-300ER from Miami to Istanbul where the aircraft was quite dated and needed repairs, the tray table was dirty, TV screen was sticky. The transit time at Istanbul Airport was quite rushed as we landed late at Istanbul and was in a hurry to catch the connecting flight to Bangkok which was supposed to depart 1 hour after my flight from Miami landed. Then when I boarded the 2nd flight to Bangkok which was an Airbus A330-300, the legroom was unacceptable for a 10 hour flight, the USB was not working on the flight, we ended up having technical issues as the TV screens were quite broken with slow quality. The real positive of this experience was the food and beverages which were alright. I think in the future I would be better off to fly with a 5 star airline for future travels. All in all, this was quite a disappointing experience and seeing how Turkish Airlines needs to update their planes in order to compete with other airlines and should definitely improve cleanliness skills.",aircraft was dated and needed repairs
Turkish Airlines,"When we flew back on July 30th Chisinau to Riga through Istanbul, our flight was not shown on the screens, there was one flight to Riga which was 30 mins before our flight. Me, my husband and 5 other people went to the wrong gate and missed our flight. The attendant from that gate told us that we are not the first people with the same issue that day and that we should go to the info centre of Turkish Airlines and they will give us a flight the other day. We went there and the staff was extremely rude. Once we approached them, the lady said: “If you are here to pay for a new flight I can assist you. If not, go somewhere else”. We went to a different info centre in Istanbul Airport and the guys started saying that it was our mistake and that we need to pay 900 eur to get new tickets Istanbul-Riga the next day.  In the end, we had to pay 860 eur for new tickets and Turkish Airlines did not care at all about this issue.",wrong gate and missed our flight
Turkish Airlines,We bought tickets through Expedia that claimed 2 checked luggage each. At check-in they only gave 1 and charged an insane amount for the second. The lady taking payment for the luggage copied down my credit card number on a piece of paper after payment cleared through the machine. Now I need to monitor for fraud. They tore a wheel off one luggage and failed to deliver another to the connecting flight. Fortunately the second flight was Lufthansa who delivered the missing luggage a few days later. Top marks for Lufthansa's luggage tracking.  Opening a support case with Turkish Airlines is like talking to a brick wall.,Expedia claimed 2 checked luggage each
Turkish Airlines,"This airline is my number one choice to travel overseas. Turkish airlines is the most organized airline I experienced from customer service to airport facilities to staff and flight attendants, all super friendly very helpful",all super friendly very helpful
Turkish Airlines,Customer service is just atrocious! I cannot recommend Turkish Airlines in the future. I was due to fly with them on July 30th. They changed my seat for my 2nd leg from Istanbul to Bangkok. We called their customer service to solve the problem. I understood that it was due to operational reasons. The app does not even feature a ticket number as their so-called mobile app gives me so much confusion all of the time! I would avoid transiting via Istanbul and Turkish Airlines on how they are treating Star Alliance gold members in the future.,Customer service just atrocious
Turkish Airlines,"The ticketing and flight experiences, both, were not just unimpressive but dismal to be exact. I booked my flight for the family of 4 - 2 adults, 2 children, from ATL to DEL via IST and back from DEL to ATL via IST. In all 4 flights, I made sure to complete seat selection online days before the flight and paid the desired amounts. But both times, Turkish Airlines disregarded my paid selections and decided to change the seats within 24 hours of the flight departure, meaning I did not have a chance to change them online. In ATL and DEL, I had to spend extra time on the check-in counter to have the family sit together because Turkish decided to assign us different seats in different rows of the airplane. The food service as well was very disappointing. While going from ATL to DEL, where we had opted for Asian Vegetarian meals and Hindu Vegetarian meals, we were given boiled spinach, white rice and boiled corn. On the return flight from DEL to ATL, we had not made food selection given the bad experience in our ATL-DEL flight. To our surprise, this time, there were no options in food other than beef. No other meat, no vegetarian options. No apologies from the flight staff, just that we do not have anything else. The staff was handing over the food with beef to passengers without telling them what it was. A major red flag when it comes to taking care of the nutritional and food habits of passengers.",dismal to be exact
Turkish Airlines,Last time that I will fly with Turkish Airlines. Flight delayed and I will miss my connection and the rebook is up to 16 hours. The customer service is not efficient and arrogant.,I will miss my connection
Turkish Airlines,"Extra legroom not possible for over 65. We booked a flight from Tashkent to Heathrow via Istanbul (12 July 2023). I am 1.97m tall and wanted to pay for extra legroom seat in economy. During booking on website, the seat selection option flagged that those over 65 cannot book exit row. It's first time I've encountered this - having flown on many other airlines where exit row can be occupied by 16 or older and capable of assisting with evacuation. Having accepted that Turkish and some other airlines set a maximum age, I searched the seat plan (Airbus A330-300) and selected extra legroom seats by bulkhead (row 11) - not shown as an exit row. All seemed ok when I completed the booking and paid. Weeks later, I completed the on-line check-in (only possible 24 hours or less before flight) which showed our extra legroom seat allocation, but when printing boarding passes we discovered we had been allocated seats in row 36. The seat pitch is too small for me and most uncomfortable for 5 hour flight. Even painful when passenger in front reclines. There seems to be an unclear or unreliable booking process. Please be warned - if you are over 65 and require extra legroom then don't book Turkish Airlines - or pay more for business class. Another comment which might help some travelers - if you are transiting in Istanbul then make sure your next flight leaves you enough time for transfer. Our flight from Tashkent to Istanbul landed 20 mins late. It then took an unbelievably long 45 mins to taxi a long way around the airport to hardstanding. Another 10 mins to disembark aircraft. It then took us 30 mins walking at a fast pace through transit and bag scan to next boarding gate where passengers had already started boarding. The flights themselves could have been better - toilets were not cleaned, all rubbish not collected (left on floor during landing). Maps would not load on in-flight information screen.",flights could have been better
Turkish Airlines,"My worst ever experience. I travelled with business class. I arrived at the airport 3 hours in advance, and got stuck in the check-in queue for nearly an hour, turned out that their elite members swamped the priority lane with their tagged family members. Check-in went super slow and staff were annoyed.  Cabin crew hardly smiled. Food were terrible.  I had a deadly long layover. My first place of departure made me not eligible for the free hotel program. And my layover was too long to be offered a nap room in the lounge. I came to the concierge desk and was told by staff: Madam, we have a policy that you can only get a nap room if your layover is between 4 to 9 hours. You can get a hotel outside but you have to pay for it. It's not in our contract. Online customer service was also terrible. I sent emails asking what I could do in my layover period. I received unhelpful and unfriendly answers.",My worst ever experience
Turkish Airlines,"Flight from Beijing to Istanbul. Application not working, not allowing you to proceed with online check in, not allow you to proceed with seat selection and upgrading purchase. During check in into airport. The person in desk said that he only can transfer us to emergency seats instead of upgrade. We accepted and received the tickets. During boarding we understand that the seats were not emergency seats. We asked to transferred there. Cabin crew asked for us to pay. We accept to pay with credit card but they did not accept any kind of credit card except of Chinese. Unbelievable",Application not working
Turkish Airlines,"I don't have anything negative to say about the flight itself, except that breakfasts was substandard. Even though we had a nominal 2.5 hour transit time in IST, ground staff at the departure gate told us that 5 minutes later, they'd closed boarding. Why? First because of late takeoff (by 30-some minutes). Second, it's 15 minutes after landing to taxi to the apron parking. Then buses to the terminal, followed by a long walk from departure area A to F, through an airport that's clearly designed to maximise sales opportunities rather than passenger convenience.  So don't dally if transfering in IST - that's the take-home message. And, not once on an 11+ hour flight (unless I was asleep) did cabin crew come to offer water. For the return, I have a 22-hour layover. I succeeded in having TK provide a hotel, but it's the Mercure Airport at the old Ataturk airport, 2 hours by public transport from the new airport.  I asked for a different hotel, only to be told that it's the system that allocates spaces, and that it's unchangeable once a hotel voucher is issued.",don't dally if transfering in IST
Turkish Airlines,"I booked wheelchair assistance for my disabled elderly mother-in-law on a trip from BER to TLV via IST. First, I could not check-in online (because of the wheel chair). When we arrived at the check-in counter, the staff were closing up. I explained that my mother-in-law was severely impaired and that we could not walk her fast enough through the check-in hall to the counter. I talked to the supervisor and they opened the flight again. The staff at the counter didn’t like this, wanted to start their coffee break and simply refused to check us in and just ignored that the flight was re-opened. I had to buy a new ticket for a substantial amount of money. Then, the mobility service dropped my mother-in-law in the lounge and never showed up again. During boarding, I had to carry my relative to the plane as there was nobody to help us.  In Istanbul, there was a mobility service, but we had to change wheelchairs three times to get to the departure gate and nearly missed the connection. When I tried to check-in for the return flight, I got the message that the flight was overbooked and we had to talk to the airline. I complained several times to TK about this disastrous service and only got standard answers and my request to raise the complaint to the manager was simply refused.",had to change wheelchairs three times
Turkish Airlines,"When I reached Casablanca, I couldn’t find my luggage. So I went to the baggage department and asked them. They informed me that the luggage was still in Istanbul and it would arrived the next day. I called the next day to check my luggage but the staff said they didn’t have any information of the whereabouts of the luggage. This is very unacceptable. How it is possible that they couldn’t give me any information of the whereabouts of it. It took many phone calls to finally get any information that the luggage was arranged to be delivered to Casablanca the next day of my arrival flight but the airport staff couldn’t confirm it was received or not and this is already the fifth day from the day I lost my luggage. They are very unorganized and unhelpful. The system is full of flaws. No information, no updates, they couldn’t help with anything. They only thing they said, “we will call you once we receive the luggage and until then there is nothing we can do”. I am staying in Casablanca for only 6 days. It took many headaches because I am here in Casablanca for someone’s birthday as well for a family’s wedding. I had to run around to find clothes, make up, shoes. All the gifts and important things are in the luggage. I even got sick and my medicines are in the luggage. I am really not recommending Turkish Airlines.",They are very unorganized and unhelpful

Turkish Airlines,"My husband and I traveled on business class from Zurich to Karachi on Saturday July 1, and Turkish managed to leave one of our bags in Zurich. I have wasted a huge amount of time trying to get the airline to get my bag back to me. First their help desk said it was on the next flight, i.e. Sunday afternoon. Then they said it would be sent on the Sunday evening flight. Now they say it will be delivered tomorrow. As of now, their helpline says the bag is in its way to me, but the tracker shows my bag sitting in Zurich airport.

Turkish Airlines,"My wife and I have the worst experience ever with Turkish Airlines. They delayed our first flight multiple times due to technical issues and finally after an entire night of delays they cancel the flight but they did not release our tickets to allow us to get reschedule our flights. So we spent all night on the phone with our booking agency and the airline help center but nobody can help us until Turkish Airlines start their shift the next day (not until 10am). When we return to the airport the next day we are told that we have been put on the same flight but when we get to the gate they are already delayed again. After about 30 minutes of waiting the staff have no answers and one of the gate employees even tells my wife If you want to make it to your destination on time you should book another flight with a different airline. Turkish Air will reimburse you because of the delays. So with that bit of terrible advice, we book another flight and try to leave the airport to check in with the new airline. But at immigration we are told that we cannot leave as our tickets have not been released (again) by Turkish Air and we were supposed to be escorted by an airline employee to immigration to fill out paperwork so we can leave. We end up sprinting through the airport as we are told by the information desk that the delayed flight is now boarding. So we finally make it to Istanbul where a Turkish Airlines employee stops all passengers with connecting flights and says he will escort us to our gates. After leisurely walking us through the airport he points down a long corridor and says our gate is at the very end. So we sprint, once again, to the gate only to find that the gate has already been closed and they would not reopen it for the 10-12 passengers who needed the transfer. So we watched as the plane pulled off the jet bridge and onto the runway feeling like we had been slighted once again. In all, we are still trying to get our money back for the extra flight we booked under Turkish Airline's advice, and we had a horrible start to our summer holiday. No matter how cheap their flights are, we won't be flying Turkish Air ever again.",a horrible start to our summer holiday

Then our luggage was lost so we had to deal with that in Athens that caused us to miss our tour that we had paid plus the taxi pick up. Coming back from ATH to IST flight #1844 was delayed again by 2 hrs and we missed our connection flight to LAX. The help desk was rude, they told us go that way past the passport control then someone can help. Confusing unclear instruction. We finally got to the passport control after waiting 30 min in line to only find out we need a visa. Passport control people were rude. We went back to visa kiosk and paid $30 per person cash only to get visa so we can stay in stay in hotel provided by Turkish Airlines. The whole thing seems business. They want you to stay in IST and spend $$$. We got the visa and passed the passport control which took another hour (3pm now) then finally found the Hotel kiosk. With no sympathy or apology they told us to wait for the shuttle bus to the hotel. No one knew where they were taking us. We drove 1 hour to get to this hotel out of no where and its now 4.30pm (Kaya Hotel). Hotel took our passports (which made us uncomfortable).

Ist - Rize Flight= Checked in two hours prior to departure, Headed to the special assistance desk to be told that they had a long line of waiting which if we were to wait, we would miss our flight, The supervisor suggested for us to walk through security and catch the buggy service which was easily available, Even though this was very painful task for my older Mother, we did as we were advised only to be told at the buggy company desk which was far further from the security that their service was chargeable as they are a private company! We had no choice but to pay the EURO 10.00 to get to the gate (ONLY) NOT to the aircraft as we requested & booked two months ago! Rize - IST flight: Checked in at the business class separate lounge, I told the hopeless only agent that we booked the special assistance and needed the car lift to up to the aircraft as Mum cannot walk the stairs as the airport has no air bridge at all, She replied confirming that all was in order, When we tried to board, We were told by the SAME agent that she could not get the car lift and that we had to walk up the stairs, I asked for her manger to attend, He told me that I did not request the assistance, I had to show him the original confirmation email, then we got the car lift to the aircraft.

However for more than four weeks we were told that the last leg of the journey was unconfirmed as it was a third party airline. We must deal with them ourselves. This third party airline says it was booked through share agreement with Turkish Airlines and they must confirm. No single phone/call centre operator could help us. Of course as we escalated the issue to become urgent with emails to the head office, they can of course change the ticket, but now the last leg of the journey will cost an additional $1489 AUD with a ticket that already cost us $3,500 return Brisbane to Croatia, via Istanbul return. We could of course cancel and get a return flight home for the same cost as the additional flight price, but they informed us that if we were to cancel the entire flight both outbound and inbound would be cancelled, with no refund.

Turkish Airlines,"At the end of January I wanted to book flights online for the end of April to Turkey in such a way that we first fly from Prague to Istanbul, stay there for a week and then continue to Antalya for another week and then from Antalya back to Prague via Istanbul. But you can't book that online like that, so I called TK customer service and asked how I should book that. The information was that I should book 2 tickets and reserve min 3 hours on the way back for the change in Istanbul. I did as instructed, booked the tickets and also had over 3 hours to change planes, arriving in IST 13:40, departing to PRG 16.45. In the weeks and months that followed, I kept getting text messages from TK saying they were changing the schedule, changing planes, etc. Most of them concerned changes of times because of the time change to daylight saving time, but one concerned the flight from AYT to IST where I was secretly rebooked on a later flight, which I unfortunately did not notice. There remained however still 1 h 45 min for the change, which is well enough. Already on the way to the airport I saw that the flight will be delayed. At the check-in, however, the boarding pass was issued to us also for IST-PRG and the luggage was checked through to PRG. The delay was then according to TK on 1 h 16 min, so quite that is not true, we took a long time to the arrival gate, where we arrived at 16:20. Already on the plane I asked several times how it would work with the connection and the last information was that I should grab the first TK employee at the exit and let him advise me. I did and the TK man at the gate told me to go to the departure gate as quickly as possible. Anyone who knows the new IST airport knows what that means. Nevertheless, we made it to the gate by 16:45 (we are both 68 years old and my last gold medal in the 5000 m run was several decades ago). But of course there was not a soul at the gate. Again I grabbed a TK employee, who referred me to the customer service counter, where of course the obligatory queue was waiting. When I showed the Pre-sorter my boarding passes, he told me immediately that no more flight today and I should wait here, so that TK look for a hotel and book new tickets. When it was my turn, the lady looked at my papers only briefly, and explained to me that I had no right to any compensation because I had booked 2 tickets. No one responded to my question about how I should have booked and they referred me to the ticket counter next door, where I had to wait almost 45 minutes for my turn. For 2 tickets to Prague they wanted $700! When I went to book the tickets online, I came up with around $500, but the lady told me she couldn't take that fare and I should book online. With the hotel and cab and dinner this story came me to over 600 € about 200 € more than the whole original booking. Since then I have been arguing with TK, repeating everything I'm sure 10 times already, but all I ever get to hear is the gramophone record: You were late at the gate and had 2 tickets, we are not to blame. On my question, how I should have booked differently, is consistent just as little addressed as also to the fact that the TK customer service had advised me to do so. I do not know what I did wrong, except that I flew TK!",do not know what I did wrong
Turkish Airlines,"Check in fine but The TSA pre check did not show up even though I had provided all the info and confirmed that by phone. Lounge shared star alliance at LAX.

Got to gate 15 mins before boarding was to start. Told to “wait here and we’ll make an announcement for boarding. Boarding started 35 mins after scheduled time. No announcements. Eventually an employee said business line up over there. And there’s a long line of people who probably were given different info.  Not a huge issue but the bad experience kept getting more irritating. The plane fine, well equipped, very helpful and welcoming staff. But there’s poor info on the website about the seats. Seat map shows 2 seats, an aisle and 2 seats. Seat map of TK website is not accurate, it’s actually one seat, an aisle, two seats, an aisle and one seat. So we were a couple on a 13 hour flight, separated by an aisle and the two seats were offset by approximately 15 inches so we couldn’t even converse across the aisle. Not a fatal flaw but an example of sloppiness. We took off an hour late with no explanation or a “we’re sorry” comment which would have been a nice touch.

I spent 48 hours including 2 trips to THY office at AYT, many phone calls to call center, and submitted several feedbacks. The response to my feedback made absolutely no sense because they were addressing the initial change on my trip I made in March 2023. In addition one of the call center staff told me that the flight is getting full, so I may not get in the same flignt I initially purchased, which created further anxiety.

Turkish Airlines,"1 week before my scheduled flight I was sent an email stating my flight from Zanzibar to Istanbul on May 3rd was canceled. This email gave no alternative flights or assistance to get another flight, they said it was canceled. When I called Turkish they stated I could cancel the entire ticket or go home on a different day, not much of a choice. I couldn’t get credit for the second leg, even though they only canceled the second leg. I moved my flight to one day earlier and left my trip on may 2nd causing me to incur charges for the hotel stay for a night I couldn’t use. Day of the flight the flight was delayed over an hour with only a 2 hour connection to my second flight on their airline. I asked if I would miss the connection and they stated I would not and the plane would be held because we would land about 6pm and the flight started boarding at 6:50 pm instead of holding the plane they had an agent get me off the plane as soon as we landed and I thought I was being rushed to my flight, but no they were rushing me to the lounge because they had already booked me on another flight the next day. So I lost another day of my vacation because I had to stay overnight in Istanbul. I also had to get a visa for Istanbul unexpectedly because I had to leave the airport. None of this was explained to me it all just happened. On May 2nd my return flight, we were headed to the airport and our cab driver told us our flight was delayed 2 hours. No email or text form Turkish airlines. We get inside the airport and flight still shows on time, I call Turkish and they said it was on time. Got to the counter and was told by that the flight was in fact delayed 2 hours and we would miss our connection and they knew about it 4 hours prior to me asking. So why weren’t we told because again we are going to miss our connection to their next flight. So I asked to be booked on the flight for the 4th because the flight on the 3rd was canceled (my original flight home). They were not willing to do that all they said they could do was put us on the delayed flight and put me on a later flight to JFK, which now I miss connection from JFK to Florida and I need a hotel in New York.  So my friend and I check in same time with same person, but when I get to JFK I have no luggage and she does. They placed my luggage on the flight to Istanbul the next morning. This was not the service they stated I would get.",not the service they stated
Turkish Airlines,"Very poor customer services. On the last flight we were told by ground staff there are not enough meals on board so we wont get any (only in case of leftovers) and we can write a complaint to the airline afterwards. When questioning the crew why we would not get any meal if we have a full price ticket, the board crew reacted very rudely and we received different answers, first as the flight is overbooked and then as we checked in as one of the last passengers (should not matter how many hours before we check as we had a valid full price ticket). At the end we received two meals, but which seemed to be from different passengers who didn't finish or want it, as several items were already missing, and one meal was already opened. However, we did not complain anymore and accepted it. Before landing another crew member came unsolicited to us again and kept arguing with us again in a very rude manner and we should be happy that we received anything and finally she left saying that's not her responsibility. In addition, we were traveling with an infant and did not get offered baby food, while other customers did. When filing a feedback with the airline afterwards, we only got the answer that they investigated but could not find any meal service irregularities on the flight and also no improper behavior of crew members (wonder how they investigate that). After some forth and back and only the typical prefabricated customer service answers and even some answers that have nothing to do with my complain (e.g. they said I should have informed the crew members - that was actually my complaint, and in a second answer that I would have to submit a doctors report) not addressing the issue at all, I gave up. It seems nobody is really reading the feedback, they only copy past some generic prefabricated answers. In addition, on the return flight our stroller that we left at the gate was handled without any care. We even saw from the airplane window how the stroller was tossed around while unloading (even ground staff I guess is probably not airline responsibility). The stroller and the basket had scratches all over the place. Even the rain cover that we put over to protect the basket to some extent was destroyed. Not to mention the delays of one hour sitting in the airline waiting for departure with an infant on each of our two flights. Overall, one of the worst flight experiences and one of the most impolite cabin crew. And even booked the more expensive TK ticket, compared to low-cost airlines for example, expecting better service in particular as we were traveling with an infant. But it turned out to be a pretty disappointing experience flying with TK and not any better than a low-cost airline. Not recommend it at all.",one of the worst flight experiences
Turkish Airlines,"What a wonderful experience with Turkish Airlines! Got to fly their new Business Class on the A350-900, and it was a really comfortable and enjoyable experience. The staff were quite welcoming and warm (though, I must admit, during the flight, it was hard to get their attention, and I don't like using the flight attendant call button). The in-flight entertainment was excellent, lots of choice of movies and music, and there was plenty of space (and privacy) in the new pod to rest as well as work comfortably. The food on TK has consistently been excellent, and this flight was no exception; it was truly a feast on board, with so many courses for the main meal after take off, and a fulfilling breakfast just before landing. A wide variety of options, and a very friendly on-board chef to prepare it for you. The wifi was difficult to connect to on my phone, but worked fine on my laptop (it was free for Business Class and Elite passengers) The cabin was clean and also kept immaculate throughout the flight. The check-in and baggage transfer and delivery on the other end went flawlessly--and the IST lounge was an excellent place to rest during the transit (with lots of food and drink options). I would really recommend Turkish, and the price was quite competitive for flights from Asia to Europe, with good connection times.",comfortable and enjoyable experience
Turkish Airlines,"3 of my 4 flights with Turkish airlines were delayed in this trip and my luggage never appered altough they told me it was onboard. Now they are still looking for my luggage with all my personal things. And it is because I contacted them, thet never did. I almost missed my 2 connections but I run the whole airport,  very bad situation. I cannot recognise this company any more.",very bad situation
Turkish Airlines,"Lisbon to Istanbul in economy. Turkish Airlines has a decent hard product but they are being let down by related infrastructure partners and service providers - boarding times are slow, emails hardly get answered and calls to the hotline rarely get connected. Despite all of that, they are one of the few airlines to have a very modern and extensive IFE system on their narrowbody aircraft, and their outreach is unparalleled because they boast the most destinations and connections of any airline at a price that’s hard to beat. Legroom is fairly generous too, sufficient without being luxurious.",Legroom is fairly generous
Turkish Airlines,We had an average experience with Turkish Airlines on April 22. We were disappointed that we could not upgrade our seats to Business Class. The legroom in the A321 economy seats were very uncomfortable for a 6 hour journey. We tried to reach out to the call centre in Istanbul to request for an upgrade to Business Class as the flight was an overnight flight between Istanbul and Abu Dhabi. Their customer service was quite awful and would likely will not choose to fly with Turkish Airlines again.,We had an average experience
Turkish Airlines,"Worst communication. We booked a flight from Dallas to Naples via Istanbul. The first flight was delayed. They told us this ends up with us missing the second flight and being put onto a flight 15 hours later than our booked flight. The second flight was scheduled for 8.25 am, the next day. The airline provided us with a hotel room and dinner in Istanbul, but they didn't provide breakfast. To use the hotel, we had to enter the city and get a visa. Turkish Airlines agent told us to pay visa by ourselves and then submit the receipts to the airline to get reimbursed, and we did. After our trip, I called their customer service, and they told me to submit the receipts through the website Feedback section. I did. Feedback responded and asked for more documents. I sent them the visa pages in the passport and all boarding passes and payment receipts. Feedback responded to me that they closed the case and are not going to reimburse. It looks weird. After getting all they needed, they refused to pay and closed the case. Again, I called customer service, and they put an objection on the case. My question is why they waste customer's time. If the Feedback department is not able to do the reimbursement, why does staff tell the customer to go through Feedback to get reimbursed. If the Feedback is able to reimburse, why do they refuse to pay after asking for more documents. It seems no one knows how to resolve this case. Just wasting our time.",are not going to reimburse
Turkish Airlines,"Never book and pay for emergency/extra legroom seats in Row 7 on the Airbus 321 aircraft. The seats have no extra legroom and they do not recline. So you pay 50 USD for an inferior seat to the normal free seats. Warning! The so called flagship lounge in Istanbul is like a cheap market food-hall and they only serve wine (self service in hidden areas), it feels like they intentionally hide the wine. Service onboard the plane is fine but at airport IST you feel like you are a nuisance to the surly and moody staff. Not one smile or welcome in two hours connecting there.",Not one smile or welcome
Turkish Airlines,"We flew with a family of (5) from SEA-IST-LHR (RT) in business class. The food and beverage service was tiny portions. The crew couldn’t communicate clearly and after serving the food and beverages did not came back to ask for water, tea or coffee. The 11 hr flight from SEA-IST was boring. The internet service was slow. We had a 10 hr layover on our return flight from LHR-SEA and when asked to use their business suite in IST we were told that thy only give room suites if the lay over is less than 9 hrs.",The crew couldn’t communicate clearly
Turkish Airlines,"Original flight IST TO BKK delayed 5 hours, cannot catch connection flight to HKT, had to reroute IST to HKT the next day. Paid for assigned seats but system auto reassignment, but airline refused to refund assign seating fee - this is cheating, rob us! We have 5 people; so we paid a lot for seat assignments. The re route flight on the next day delayed another 2 hours. Flight attendants always push to close the windows, and air con not cold enough - basically push us to sleep, so they don’t have to service. The aircraft is old and not clean - don’t fly this airline, the worst ever.",don’t fly this airline
Turkish Airlines,"They don't allow enough time for passengers to change flights so they end up spending hours at Istanbul Airport. There's no way you can run and catch a flight in 60 minutes, with doing all the security checks. No airport staff available to assist you in fast tracking and definitely no carts that can rush passengers to their terminals. I waited for 6 hours for the next flight; and everyone was clueless what's the boarding gate.",I waited for 6 hours
Turkish Airlines,"Ok flight but internet on board is a mission. Beyond me why Turkish wants name, email, password, captcha and in the end it didn't work. Simplify the process, I was willing to pay but in the end resigned myself to reading a book and they lost out on $8.",internet on board is a mission
Turkish Airlines,"Horrible experience! No leg room. They are just trying to make money by cramming every last airplane seat they can into the plane to fit more people. It was terribly uncomfortable, the seat was rigid, the head support flaps didn’t work at all to hold your head in place while sleeping, you can’t extend your legs. It was the worst international flight I’ve had. I will not be using Turkish airlines again.",No leg room
Turkish Airlines,After booking and paying extra charges for more leg room the seat allocation went wrong and we ended up seats with no extra leg room. This was on the outbound flight. The inflight staff was nice and polite but were unable to help. The same goes for the call center staff. This happened on the returning flight and there was no help from the people at Turkish Airlines. They either made useless promises or told us the system was down.,seats with no extra leg room
Turkish Airlines,"The seats were so congested and they barely had any leg room. The front pockets on the seats were torn so everything would fall down. Twice I had seats where the push back button wasn't working so I could not move my seats a little behind to rest my head. We just got a little decent food once both ways.  I asked for coffee, I rang the bell and the attendant came but never came back. My mother asked for coffee once and she got it but we had to call the attendant back because he forgot to give us creamer and sugar. Entertainment wise there wasn't any good collection of movies. I guess since they charge less, you get get cheap service.",seats were so congested
Turkish Airlines,"I recently had an extremely disappointing experience with Turkish Airlines, and I feel compelled to share my frustration to caution others about the challenges I faced while trying to resolve a baggage fee issue. My original flight, TK717, was scheduled to fly from Delhi to Istanbul on Mar 30, 2023, at 6:20 AM, before continuing to Dallas and Toronto. Unfortunately, the flight was cancelled due to a technical issue with the fuelling system. Turkish Airlines provided accommodation and rebooked me on a flight via Air India. The problem arose with my additional baggage. I had already paid for an extra bag with Turkish Airlines, but they failed to carry forward this payment to my new flight with Air India. I had to pay for the same additional bag twice. I reached out to Turkish Airlines for a refund and compensation, but they directed me to Air Canada, claiming it was a codeshare flight operated by Air Canada. However, this is not true, as the flight I am talking about, TK717, was operated by Turkish Airlines. I have tried to communicate with Turkish Airlines multiple times, providing them with the correct information, but they keep diverting responsibility and have not resolved my issue. It is incredibly frustrating and disappointing to be treated this way by an airline I had trusted. Based on my experience, I give Turkish Airlines 1 star out of 5. Their customer service has been extremely unhelpful, and their inability to address a simple issue has left me feeling undervalued and frustrated. I sincerely hope no one else has to go through such an ordeal with Turkish Airlines.",extremely unhelpful
Turkish Airlines,"I flew from Frankfurt to Istanbul, and I had an option of one night stay in Istanbul. I went to customer service desk after going through customs and getting a visa. I claimed to get a hotel as I did want to continue my journey to Saudi Arabia, and I was feeling nauseous. I spoke with Turkish Airlines agent, she told me she has a later flight, then the manager came telling me that they have a hospital upstairs.",I claimed to get a hotel
Turkish Airlines,"I checked in at Frankfurt Turkish Airlines counter with no problem and easy check in and received both boarding passes (first flight and connecting flight both Turkish Airlines). Good flight to Istanbul. But at Istanbul when I went to the gate for my second Turkish flight, the employee tell me my carry on is overweight and demanded 36 EUR. I explained that I checked in at Frankfurt and there was no issue on weight and how could the carryon suddenly be overweight. I only had an hour to get to my connection and of course did not have time to even go to a store to buy anything it was the same carry on as in Frankfurt. Unprofessional and I will not fly with Turkish again. They got 36 EUR extra but lost a customer.",tell me my carry on is overweight
Turkish Airlines,"When booking my flight, I originally had a 4 hour layover, but Turkish Airlines asked if I wanted to extend my layover to 20 hours and participate in the Istanbul Stopover program, where they provide free hotels to travellers with layovers over 12 hours. Over a month before traveling, I sent in the request for the stopover (which only needed to be submitted 72 hours before departure). I was sent a hotel voucher for the wrong date and name, so I emailed back to correct it. The Turkish team did not respond to my 5 emails over the course of a month to correct it. When I got to my layover in Istanbul, I assumed that if I explained this and showed the emails, I could get a hotel or some compensation.  Their reason for not allowing my stopover was that there was another flight from Athens to Istanbul the next day that I could have taken and had a four hour layover. I called customer service who made me submit an urgent ticket that would be resolved within a few hours. My ticket was not resolved and I had to sit in the airport with no apology or compensation.",I assumed that if I explained this
Turkish Airlines,"The initial travel experience was as expected for flying economy on 3 hour flights. On landing they had lost my baggage (2 items) i traveled with a co worker and his arrived as scheduled and there was more than adequate time between connections. It took over 48 hours for my bags to be located and during this time i received no answer on telephone or email or online chat. when my bags arrived the suitcase was damaged. I submitted a case through there website and they concluded it was caused by the baggage carousel. I had to collect the baggage at my expense, this is all over 2 weeks ago and I still haven't received any compensation and and completely missing any contact with the airline customer service.",haven't received any compensation
Turkish Airlines,"We were loyal Turkish Airlines fliers for many years until this experience. Our saga started when we purchased 4 business class segments for my wife and my honeymoon in February 2022 for almost $8K. Due to Covid, we tried to change them over the course of the next year. This airline has arbitrary change fees that are not listed anywhere on their website. They are allowed to quote you whatever fees they would like at the time of the change request. As such, we were told that our new tickets would need to be roughly $5600 to qualify for the change, with an additional $600 per ticket change fees, so $9k in total for a $5600 flight. We agreed, but disputed the change fee with Amex. Amex found in our favor for $600, issuing the credit and we looked forward to our honeymoon. Fast forward, we arrived to the gate in February 2023 for our new flight and were told for the first time that our tickets were *suspended* and that we no longer had tickets. After speaking to ticketing agents and phone agents, both of which said there was nothing they could do (more on this later) we finally were able to speak to the Newark sales manager who was highly unprofessional and unhelpful, trying to convince us that we were not owed anything and essentially too bad. In the end, we were forced to purchase last minute economy tickets for almost $4K with a one way upgrade for $2500, as we did not want to jeopardize our hotel reservation and ruin our honeymoon further. Over the course of the next 2 weeks, like many here, we emailed the feedback form many times (as others noted, this airline's phone personnel have no authority to make any financial decisions and all must be done via online feedback forms). We received many unhelpful responses, refusing to give us any compensation or help us in any way. All references were made to speak to our bank. Finally, we decided to upgrade our economy leg home for another $2500 and take this matter up when we got home. In the end, we paid about $8600 just to have to pay another $8.5K and fly in two 8 hour economy segments versus the 4 business segments we originally purchased. I'm sure that in the meantime, Turkish resold our original seats last minute for much higher than the original $8k we paid 5 months before the flight. In short, this was the worst travel experience of our lives and showed clearly the unethical business practices of this airline. 1) They will suspend your tickets without notice, forcing customers to purchase last minute segments at the gate. There are numerous other cases here of flier having their tickets arbitrarily suspended. 2) You will not be able to make changes, receive refunds or do any customer service action of any value through the phone with them. You will be forced to use an antiquated online feedback form that does not even track your previous correspondence. There are no personnel in any airport, including in Istanbul that have the authority to issue flight changes, credits or refunds. 3) They do not have a clear change fee policy. If you need to change your flight, be prepared to spend months trying to communicate with them on the aforementioned form and in the end they can quote you any amount, you're on your own.",the worst travel experience of our lives
Turkish Airlines,"We had a flight ticket issued by Turkish Airlines with one connection in Istanbul. Because of the delay of the 1st flight, we missed the 2nd one (whereas we reached the boarding gate 10mn before departure time!). However, the delay was known before the take off and increased during the flight. And none of the crew members was able to give us information. The 2nd did not to wait for us whereas we could have caught the flight if the gate was still open 10 minutes before the departure time. Anyway, after this missed connection, we were sent to 3 different desks during more than 2 hours to get through our missed flight: transfer desk, ticket sales and hotel desk. We got poor information and no one from Turkish Airlines apologized. In the end, we finally got a flight for the next day (24 hours later) and a hotel in Istanbul. We sent a complain and refund request to Turkish Airlines to get compensation and Turkish Airlines rejected all requests.",sent a complain and refund request
Turkish Airlines,"Turkish Airkines still does have real business class seats on European flights; boarding in Istanbul was a rush. A non alcoholic welcome aboard drink was offered, however my food in business class was sub par ; extremely dry chicken with some rice. The wines and the alcoholic drinks were extremely basic. It was an afternoon flight however FA found it appropriate to dimm the cabin lights until 15 minutes before landing. I do not like to travel during daytime in a darkened cabin. The FA doing the business section were extremely friendly. I will not chose this airline anymore.",not chose this airline anymore
Turkish Airlines,"Their marketing is great but in reality the service is horrible. The airline lost my baggage at Istanbul airport during transfer. The customer service was incapable of giving any information and was rude and not willing to help. Since then the my claim to refund expenses due to lost baggage get ignored. Neither several phone calls with the service hotline or messages of the lost baggage tracking system help. My request got terminated. Moreover, on the same trip on the way back, the flight was overbooked and I had to take a 4h later flight. Hence I am entitled to a compensation of 200EUR. I got a form which states that and was told to submit that online over the feedback from.

No second service for drinks, several connecting flights were announced, others not. I will not chose that company again.",No second service for drinks
Turkish Airlines,Food on the Bishkek to Istanbul leg was woeful. It was an awful sort of mini ham and cheese sandwich. Food on the much shorter Istanbul to Amsterdam route was delicious however with chicken in a sort of yoghurt sauce. Crew on both legs were friendly. IFE is disappointing on Turkish.  It's a bit annoying having to board past Business who are already enjoying their orange juices and canapes!,IFE is disappointing
Turkish Airlines,"Easy to search and book a ticket. The flight crew were kind enough, nothing out of the usual but attentive and kind when asking for extra items or drinks etc. Economy window seats were fine even for someone fairly tall as me (190cm / 6.3”). Flights were on time. Every time they rescheduled a flight I lost my seat booking I paid extra for and I had to get in contact with Turkish customer service. I have on record 40 calls and 9 feedback forms filled in with the simple request to have the seat or similar seat I paid extra for. I first got denied boarding because the gate staff at Edinburgh airport was not familiar with my passport nationality telling me sthat I’m unable to board the plane without a pre-approved visa for Singapore. When in reality, you simply fill in the SG arrival pass and you are good to go. Which I explained and told her exactly where she could find this information.  I turned to the other gate agent and showed my passport and let me on the flight. While on my trip I had my trip rescheduled twice and I spotted something different with my flight. It seemed like my flight had been split up into two single journeys instead of a connecting one. Which would mean I had to check out my luggage and check it in again during my transfer. So I call their agents asking to confirm if this is the case and to double check if my tickets are still connecting. First one said bit to quickly, yes everything is fine with your tickets no worry. I message their facebook page to ask the same question with more details, they say it’s no issue and they tickets are connected. I felt something did not look right so I called again to their customer support and this time the agent told right away. Yes they are separate and we will right away go ahead and connect them again. Once and never again.",had my trip rescheduled twice
Turkish Airlines,"TK is fabulous on the ground, outstanding inflight with professional cabin service and best food in the airline industry, and 1gb free wifi is amazing. Unfortunately all of that is wasted by the fact that they fly old, outdated equipment with old, outdated 2-2-2 configuration with zero privacy from your seatmate and people crawling over you or you crawling over them to get to aisle unless you are on the center section. It's a shocker that TK hasn't remotely kept up with their competition in this regard. It's like flying business class in the 1990s. Power ports in inaccessible locations rarely work, seat controls inadequate. So instead of a review of 10/10 I'd love to give, it gets knocked down to 5/10 as a result of all of this. I would not use TK in this configuration unless there was no other choice or the price was very cheap. They desperately need a refresh of this old livery or just new planes. All four of my flights were old A330s that didn't even have privacy screens between seats. What are they thinking?","old, outdated equipment"
Turkish Airlines,"I found Turkish Airlines to be excellent. The service on all 4 sectors (LHR- IST- JNB return) was really fantastic. The food was great and very tasty and the cabin crew were kind, caring and very helpful. I think there service is much better than Emirates. The inflight entertainment is excellent too. My mother needed assistance and she was looked after. I cannot fault Turkish Airlines in any way. The A350 aircraft is really comfortable however the A330 is a little cramped this us why I give a 9 instead of a 10","kind, caring and very helpful"
Turkish Airlines,"I had in the past lots of good experiences. I liked the airline and promoted for them. Unfortunately, three times from last year until now I was hopeful they will get back on track and serve their customers. But that is not the case. I might be really expectant.

Turkish Airlines,"I had the worst experience with Turkish Airlines yesterday as my first flight was delayed by 35min (according Turkish staff), and a promise was made by them: that Istanbul was contacted previously and all the connecting flights will be waiting. In reality there was a 1.5 hours delay for a 2 hours long flight, meaning I missed the connection in Istanbul only with 10 minutes. The connecting flight was still there therefore it would take only a little organization and 10 minutes to 5-6 people from our flight to reach it. The flight staff didn’t have any information about our connection before we landed. On arriving in Istanbul, there was no apology or direction of what to do, actually the staff was extremely rude! There was no food or drink offered, just a new boarding pass and deal with the consequences. No phone call was offered to reorganize our trip, just promises the hotel will provide it. Of course the hotel didn’t do such thing. I know that delays happens but real customer support, correct and valid information or some kindness would make it easier.

I would like to remind Turkish Airlines that people travel for different reasons and mine was to spend time with my 87 year old mother.

With no apparent reason, they decide to move the Hong Kong - Istanbul flight to the 6th of January, which means now I have a 29 hours transfer instead of 4 hours. I tried to ask for compensation, but did not get a single cent. At the phone and by e-mail they either send me to my agency where I bought the tickets or they give me conventional, pre-made excuses. At their airport stand they send me to a Turkish Airlines agency, at the Turkish Airlines agency they send me to their central offices in Taksim.

Turkish Airlines,"My outbound flight was delayed by a couple of hours in Manchester, and I missed the connection in Istanbul. On arriving in Istanbul, there was no apology or direction of what to do, I was stuck in the airport for almost 6 hours. There was no food or drink offered, no accommodation, just a new boarding pass. Having sat in an uncomfortable chair for the delay and waiting for the first flight out in the morning, my flight took off and arrived in Kayseri. I had a bad feeling at the luggage collection and just knew my bad luck was to continue. No sign of my luggage and the conveyor belt stopped. I was told to go to another location of the airport as my luggage was there. On arriving, I was told my luggage was still in Manchester and had not been loaded to my original flight. I registered my contact details and was given a reference number and number on Whatsapp. I was told my luggage would be there the next day. One night without my luggage wasn't ideal but manageable. The next day I whatsapped the number, which was Kayseri airport, not Turkish Airlines and they said it had not arrived and to contact the airline. I had to call an international number, costing me money each time, to get information on where my bag was. I was told later that day it would arrive. I got no call and followed up that day, no luggage. I was in Kayseri for 4 days and my luggage didn't arrive there at any point. 4 days without my own clothes, toiletries, shoes, etc. Each day, I received no communication from the airline and had to call them, at a cost, to see where it was. They had no idea and couldn't tell me where it was or when it would arrive. I had to go shopping on Day 3, to buy new underwear, clothes and shoes, as I could not wear the same clothes the whole time. The airline said keep all receipts for costs associated with this and I would be compensated. My luggage finally arrived in Istanbul airport, when I left Kayseri after 4 days and 4 nights without my luggage. It cost me over $200 to buy new clothes, taxis, phone costs, etc. It ruined the 4 days in Kapadokya.  On returning home, I tried to get compensation for the lost luggage, which has been a nightmare. They did compensate me for the delay, per EU rules, however they will not meet my costs for the delayed luggage, not even paying me enough to buy new clothes and essential items. They were responsible for ruining my holiday to Kapadokya, yet they will not compensate me for these 4 days, let alone meet the essential costs. No apology, no responsibility, just automated answers about how they love treating their customers as a priority and look forward to welcoming me again. I would avoid TK if there is another option, their customer service is severely lacking, they have no care for customers who want to enjoy Turkey and boost tourism.",I tried to get compensation

After cruising the whole airport I finally stop in front of info counter not far away from Center Big Screen of Duty Free Area and ask for Care Point location but rudely shouted at by counter staff.

Turkish Airlines,"The worst experience I have ever had! The app is horrible and faulty, I could never get my miles and smiles rewards number to work and no one to help me, they lost my luggage and the phone number given to me did not work. After many calls the rep on the phone said they couldn't help me and the system was not updated. They rerouted my flight and never gave me a ticket to my destination and I had to pay for an additional ticket from a different airline. Again the customer service agent in Istanbul told me he did not know what to do, and told me to call a number in the USA that didn't work.  The seating arrangements were messed up with multiple people having the same seats. Not one person who works for this airline could ever give me any information. All the answers were answered with I don't know. I still don't have my bag after they said they found it and would send me a tracking number.",I still don't have my bag
Turkish Airlines,"I must say, there cannot be a WORSE airline than Turkish airlines. The customer service is absolutely, ridiculously horrible, and they have no clue as to how to handle any sort of claim whatsoever. I made a reservation last February in 2022, and had to cancel it in a couple of days. They said they couldn’t give me a refund which is OK because it was non-refundable fare. However, they said I would get an airline credit for $813 which I could use towards a ticket in the future. - Provided I made my reservation by Feb 23, 2023. The travel date could be for a future date AFTER Feb 23, 2023 as stated by the reservation agent - I could use the credit for ANY destination in the world within their network (again not true, it had to be the same route) However, I tried to make a reservation in December 2022 and now they tell me that there is a change fee of $270. Which was not communicated to me. Also, they said that I have to travel AND RETURN by Feb 23, 2023 which was not communicated to me. Finally, I opened up a ticket and after hundreds of calls back-and-forth with imbeciles operating the phones at Turkish airlines. Not a single responsible person manager could relate to the case and do the right thing. I recommend do not travel this airline if you want to keep your sanity and your money!",customer service is absolutely horrible
Turkish Airlines,"1. My original flight was from SFO to BOM via IST and I caught covid 1 day before the flight. I called Turkish airlines multiple times to let them know if the same and that I needed to change my reservation. They told me to submit a feedback and after waiting for over a month and over 100 calls to Turkish Airlines, I never got the flight re-scheduled not I got full refund through them. Turkish Airlines website says that they offer full refund due to COVID. I had initially uploaded all the documentation (PCR tests, Passports, etc.,) 2. I eventually made another flight reservation through TK website and at the destination my bags were lost by Turkish Airlines. My bags were checked through to the destination. I received my bags after several phone calls to BOM airport and more than 24 hours later. I received $0 as compensation from Turkish Airlines. 3. I had flown business class throughout and TK, as part of miles&smiles only gave me economy miles. When I submitted another feedback form to claim miles for my business class paid upgrades, they denied and said they only give miles for the original paid ticket. I wouldn't recommend flying with them. They have bad customer service.",wouldn't recommend flying with them
Turkish Airlines,"Booked FRA-IST-NBO. Delayed out of FRA with no explanation. Cabin crew could offer no explanation on my onward connection other than that the connection was on the screen in the cabin. They didn't even know what gate we would arrive on and refused to ask the captain. After arriving in IST 30 mins late we spent 20 minutes taxiing to the gate. No assistance at the gate for all transferring passengers. With 20 mins before the onward flight it is futile to try to make the connecting gate. Totally unsuitable for a hub operation unless you got a day to walk to your next gate. Made it to the TK service center and they offered a hotel and rebooking on the same flight to NBO the next day. I was not spending 24hrs in an Istanbul hotel so opted for the IST-DXB-NBO connection. Again a delayed 15 min departure from IST to DXB and although transfer time in DXB was 90 minutes i had to hurry to transfer between terminals. Made it to NBO at 1330 local, 10 hours later than the original flight. Overall poor inflight product and service from Turkish Airlines, both on the ground as Inflight. The only thing that did go right is that they managed to get my bag on the same flights as i was on.",poor inflight product and service
Turkish Airlines,"Terrible experience. Started with a very poor check-in experience using their appp, and wouldn't progress past the seat selection stage where it kept glitching so I had to do it on my laptop instead, and then the app wouldn't show the boarding passes. Then, at the gate despite an announcement saying boarding would be by seat number, it was simply a free-for-all and the staff didn't even try to order things. I was in the middle passengers to board the aircraft. As I was at the end of the tunnel just about to get on the plane, the airport staff brought down passengers with mobility issues or requiring assistance. Myself and another passenger stood aside as asked (and as you should do) to await these passengers being boarded. Turns out that was a big mistake - several other passengers pushed past us (and those with mobility issues), which is relevant later. When finally aboard, it was clear that the flight was overbooked as noone could find anywhere to put their bags and the queue in the aisle was very long and slow. The passengers who had shoved past were getting their bags slotted into the last remaining spaces by crew. I also noted one gentleman who had severe mobility issues and who had been brought to the aircraft by wheelchair being asked to move seats by a crew member and struggling to do so with no assistance. Then I was told that my bag would need to be put in the hold. I tried to protest, explaining that I had intentionally travelled long-haul with hand luggage only to avoid these waits at the carousel and potential delays and missed connections, and had had recent terrible experiences with this, but the crew were entirely unhelpful and just chucked lots of our bags in the hold. These are all people who boarded around the middle of the cohort, so I can only imagine how many bags were relegated to hold in total. There were no reminders from staff to remove important or disallowed items from bags before they were taken to the hold - hopefully noone left their passports in there! This was all followed up by one of the most uncomfortable seat experiences of my life - and that's coming from someone who can sleep pretty much anywhere. There was barely any legroom, the seats weren't particularly comfy and as soon as the person in front reclined even slightly the screen was practically in your face. Arm rests also in an odd position. No USB or other charging points which is quite unusual these days. Not woken for my meal, so didn't have anything, and was only lucky to catch someone's eye long enough to get a drink. I flew with Turkish Airlines a few years ago (LHR-HK via IST) and actually had a very nice experience, but they have definitely gone down the pan since then with none of the nice touches. Would absolutely pay more to avoid flying with this airline in future.",avoid flying with this airline in future
Turkish Airlines,"The customer service is terrible, they communicate with you via feedback, that's not helpful when you are rushing. They canceled the flight, we were promised our Uber fees would be reimbursed at the airport, but no one reimbursed it. I reached out and I was promised I would get it in miles, but I haven't gotten a dime back. I wish they never canceled Moscow flight, I would never use Turkish airlines otherwise.",customer service is terrible
Turkish Airlines,"It was the worst experience that I ever had. I bought 3 tickets for myself, my wife and my 19 month old son since we need extra room when we are flying. We flew from Los Angeles to Tashkent via Istanbul and back from Tashkent to Los Angeles after spending 2 weeks in Tashkent with 3 days stop in Istanbul. We really liked Istanbul and it's touristic attractions. We bought tickets via Expedia and I paid full price for my son's ticket. When checking in in Istanbul TK representatives told us that we have to buy new ticket for our son since the one we bought was a child ticket, but it has to be a baby ticket as our son is under 2 years old. They told us that on previous 3 hops TK made a mistake allowing our baby onboard and they sent us to to a ticket office where I got charged an additional 130 USD for a new ticket for our son. It's the kind of Turkish Bazar experience you get when you deal with TK. It was a very stressful situation for our family as we were almost late to our flight to LA. I was very angry and was not able to sleep during our flight to LA. It's a completely different experience with Turkish Airlines in other countries as in Tashkent/Uzbekistan and Los Angeles their representatives are more customer focused. 3 years ago I had another bad experience with Turkish Airlines in Istanbul when TK oversold tickets to our flight to Los Angeles. They push people who bought tickets in advance with cheaper rates to stay and chose a different flight making a priority for those who paid higher buying tickets closer to departure date. That creates a stressful experience for the passengers since they don't have seats on their boarding passes. They first push you that you don't have seat available and later gamble proposing bonuses to passengers to abandon a flight and you have to stand firm to take your flight. Somebody agrees at the end to abandon a flight. Our Turkish Airlines experience was so bad that it spoilt our impression about our vacation in Turkey. We would try to avoid this airline and country in overall for upcoming vacations.",It was the worst experience
Turkish Airlines,"Because of covid and the fare I paid, my expectations were low. However, it ended up being one of the best experiences, the other one being with Swiss Airlines over a decade ago. The food did not give me the indigestion I usually have with airlines food. It was fast and expeditiously served without the personnel being rude, dismissive, or in a hurry.  Some bad turbulences were well handled. People may think that there isn't much an airline can do about turbulences, however, I have flown a lot in this lifetime. If you pay attention, there is actually a lot that can be done.  I have been on many flights where I expected something like the felt slippers to be provided. Feet can start hurting and aching when stuck in hard shoes for 10+ hours. Nothing was ever provided. Restrooms were very clean. I have paid more for tickets for shorter flights on hyped airlines where strangely it wasn't feasible to keep the restrooms clean.  Customer service, on the phone as well as at check-in at the airport was very professional, meaning detailed and efficient without making me feel that they are forced to serve me because I paid for the ticket or because they have security regulations to follow.",one of the best experiences
Turkish Airlines,"Took TK from Manila to Ankara via Istanbul in Business Class with A350. I used to fly the same route with Boing 777. Both are good planes but A350 has a better concept for Privacy I guess the families with children may prefer Boing 777. Departed on time received good service and good food. Wi fi was excellent. It seems like There is some additional investment on cabin crew. This time I found them much better, well trained and service oriented. Istanbul to Ankara it was Boeing 777 which was unusual and Business class had 60 to 65% occupancy. This flight was probably the worst domestic flight experience I have ever had. Crew was so noisy talking to each other and using the trolleys to serve the meals. On the way back from Istanbul we had approximately 40 min late departure due to connecting flights and it was also a nice flight",well trained and service oriented
Turkish Airlines,"I flew together with my girlfriend, our flight was delayed for more than 4 hours. Passenger rights regulation EC261/2004 states a compensation of 600 euros per ticket.

I complained and they offer more miles, then I complained again and they offer more miles again when I clearly stated that I don't want their miles.  Be careful with this airline, they don't respect the passenger right, rights which can be download also from their website. Further more, according to their own rules, for a delay of more than 3 hours, you have the right to have a cold/hot drink, a snack and a meal. When I asked for it at their desk at the airport, they said that as the flight was delayed for less than 5 hours, I have to ask for these at the boarding gate, gate that would be shown 4 hours later. Finally at the gate they offer a bottle of water at room temperature, nor cold nor hot and a disgusting looking sandwich that of course we didn't take.",stated that I don't want their miles

Air France,"I flew to Bucharest out of HND via CDG in Business Class with Air France. In the first leg, on seating myself on a business class seat, I felt squeezed in. Whenever I got out of my seat for a rest room or something, I could not help grabbing the backrest of the seat just in front of mine, which finally caused him to make a complaint to me. For dinner, no Japanese food was available. More than that, the main Western course they served was not suitable for my typical Japanese taste. However, I found it logical, because one of the roles AF assumes is to spread French culture. After dinner ample refreshments ,such as fruits, chocolates, and biscuits were presented with a bottle of champagne at the galley. It was the so-called help-yourself service. On the other hand, I did see what I didn’t want to see: not a few flight attendants were bent on chatting each other. They didn’t intend to replace an empty bottle with a new one. Two hours prior to arrival, as regular breakfast was served, French butter, regrettably whose brand name I forgot, was noteworthy. In the second leg, regular European business class with middle seat empty. The meal served here was tasty (see photo). The portion of cheese was impressive. Serving generous amount of champagne was highly appreciated. The plane landed on OTP as scheduled.",“I felt squeezed in”

Air France,"Copenhagen-Paris 30 Dec. 2023 on new A220-300. Checked-in in airport took only a few minutes and the officer was kind, accommodating, and professional. I was allowed luggage check-in beyond Paris the whole way to Africa despite on a different ticket and on an airline without any alliance. That saved me a lot of time and hassle in transit in Paris going to a distant terminal. As a Flying Blue status holder I was respected and could choose seat freely. Thus, I pampered myself with an entire exit row. The two lounges AF uses in CPH are both quite fine: the Apartment is a quiet restaurant with nice buffet, while the Carlsberg is merely a noisier bar with snacks and cold foods. One can choose among freely them and even walk forth and back if so wanted. Gate boarding on time. Onboard, drinks and wines were flowing freely and staff were good. Cold sandwiches served. On time. Luggage delivered to final destination. Highly recommended.",Highly recommended
Air France,"In almost 50 years traveling this was the worst experience. Considering I was traveling in business class as platinum member. Plane was old, configuration 2 3 2. Regretfully I had a seat next to a very unpolite man. Unfortunately it was a very long flight since there was a stop over in BKK. The purser getting off at BKK told me good luck and I needed it. This man started cutting his nails, he was also unstable and pants were down every time he stood up to go to toilet. He has been noisy all 12 hours flight and had been arguing with other passengers. A nightmare cause I was the closest to him. I wanted to relax with a gin and tonic and it was not available on all plane. This was May 2022.

My wife's gluten free meal was served frozen. When I complained they offered some crisps and nothing else - despite me asking if they could see if there were any other options for food. I ended up leaving my earbuds in the pocket. Complained afterwards, it was a torturous process. Customer Services never answered my complaint. Everything was generic and they then closed down the complaint right afterwards. I had to keep opening up new complaints just so I could get someone to respond.

Air France,"I bought a combined flight from Gdansk to Lima, tickets were not cheap and I payed full ticket price. But when I was checking in for the flight 20 hours in advance, I was granted a standby seats for all 3 flights. Moreover, my friend checked in later, and she were not given a standby seats. When I reached the support in WhatsApp, they asked me to come to the airport earlier and address my issue to Air France agent. I went to the airport at 2.30 a.m. (my flight was scheduled at 6:15). There were nobody to help me. And there were no Air France agent of course! The advice in WhatsApp was to wait until boarding starts and go to check in desk. But at check in desk they could not give me the boarding pass and sent to the gate. At the gate they asked to wait. And only after boarding started, I received boarding passes. I’ve been in a constant stress for more than 24 hours. No assistance and no support. On my way back I had 3 flights provided by air France and the final flight provided by another company. I had much time for interchanges bettween flights. But as a result, every flight has been delayed. My final flight was at 23:05, and I arrived with air France at 22:58.  The only thing I am grateful for is cabin crew. I asked them to provide me with possibility to run first from the plane. Thank you for this opportunity! So again only nerves and stress. In Paris before the check in they decided to make all the passengers to move to another part of the airport, as the gate changed unexpectedly. After some delay air France application showed me a message that I am entitled to compensation, but when I clicked the message for several times, error occurred: Sorry, something went wrong.

However, they failed to retag my luggage which remained in Paris and only arrived to Denmark 2 days later. They delivered it faultlessly by courier the entire way to my address in a distant area, 80 km from airport. I was well informed on the progress.

Air France,"Nov 2023 Flight from Vancouver to Rome with stopover via Paris. We landed at the opposite end of the airport and had to dismount onto the tarmac in pouring rain. No overhead coverings to keep the passengers out of the wet and cold; many passengers were rightly not expecting this and not dressed accordingly. We were crammed onto a shuttle bus and transported to the security checkpoint. Plane disembarkation to security checkpoint took about 25-30 minutes. Our next flight was with Air France and the scheduled layover was 1hr 40mins. Massive lineup at the security checkpoint and were shunted to a severely understaffed overflow line. This overflow line had approx. 3 planes worth of passengers and they were being screened by 1 staff member using an old system – baggage and security trays were ferried by hand, no automation whatsoever. There was a free line next to us but that was exclusively for the 20 or so flight staff, all other passengers were ignored. It took 1hr and 10mins to get through the security checkpoint. There were arguments with passengers and staff, there were arguments with passengers and passengers as people were beginning to panic that they were about to miss their connecting flights. People were begging each other to be let through first, but all were in the same situation. Other lines to our right were moving quickly again but people were expressly forbidden by staff from transferring lines, nor did they offer to redirect. Once we were through, we went straight to our flight gate as they were beginning to final call our names over the PA system. Keep in mind we were as efficient as the airport allowed us to be, no bathroom breaks, no shopping, and walking as quickly as possible. Doors closed a few minutes after boarding and there were still at least 70 people in the line at the security checkpoint many of whom had now missed their flights through no fault of their own. At our departing flight from Venice to Vancouver (via CDG and Seattle) I had found that my PR Card was lost or stolen and denied boarding the flight; saying that the USA would not let us through. Even though I had my valid PR number, Passport and ID they would not let me board without the plastic card. The staff were not helpful or sympathetic and were offering bad immigration advice – they were insistent that we quickly purchase a tourist travel visa to Canada online – as much as we told them that was for non-residents only and even showed them policy on the Canadian Immigration website, they were insistent that was the only way they would now let us through as apparently they were now deputised as US immigration officials. We informed them that we as Permanent Residents were allowed to privately cross the US-CAN border in our own vehicle and we asked them to cancel to Seattle-Vancouver leg of the journey and let us finish the flight in Seattle. They told us to go to the ticket desk 30 meters away and try there. Once we got to the indicated ticket desk, they were confused what we were doing there and told us to go back to the Air France staff who had clearly fobbed us off, and again told us they can’t cancel the last leg of the trip.",not let me board without the plastic card
Air France,"Booked a flight with Air France, then had to change plans. Looked at the cancellation/refund policy and it said they would refund if cancelled within 24 hours. I thought I was within the 24 hour window, so I went to my booking to cancel. There was nothing on the cancellation confirmation saying that I was outside the 24 hour window, which I was. When I realised my mistake about 20 minutes later, I thought it was better to keep the flight than cancel and get zero refund. I went back to the website, and it said refund takes awhile to process. I didn't see anyway to stop the cancellation process. I called them and they said I need to contact the refund team, I asked how, they said they would do it for me.

Air France,"If you live outside of the EU, Air France will not compensate you for a severely delayed or cancelled flight. On September 22, just a few hours before boarding an Air France flight from Vancouver to Paris, I was informed by email that Air France had cancelled my second flight from Paris to Nairobi where I was supposed to begin a safari. My only option was to take a Kenya Air flight from Paris to Nairobi, 12 hours after I landed at Charles de Gaulle airport. Usually when you are forced to wait 12 hours because your airline cancels your flight, you are offered a minimum of 600 Euro compensation (this is even written on the Air France info site). But Air France refuses to compensate me, using the loophole of an obscure 2004 regulation that states that if the flight does not originate or end within the EU, they're off the hook. First of all, my cancelled flight 814 originated in Paris, which in the middle of the EU. Secondly, since when does an international airline that flies all over the world, compensate only those who fly witin the EU? Air France has an obligation to treat all customers equally, and not give preferential treatment to customers who fly only within the EU. When I flew from Dublin to Vancouver last year, and the flight was delayed by 10 hours, Air Canada paid me compensation.",Air France refuses to compensate me
Air France,"Very disappointing and that has become the normal experience with Air France. Poor catering on board, and on a nine-hour flight no one came to offer more drinks. I went to the back to fetch my own but found that the cabin crew had sealed off our compartment (limiting 16 rows to one toilet) with locked curtains, so they can be alone. Upon arrival, there was no wheelchair for me (and this happens all the time at CDG airport). I have an artificial leg and it is difficult for me to walk long distances, yet they have me walk up the boarding bridge to the lobby, then walk outside to catch their van, where it drops you off at another terminals and you have to walk up steps and then an elevator and then a longish walk to where they have their wheelchair staff. If you wish to fly with this group, choose KLM who are efficient, they have wheelchairs available when you arrive, take you to where you want to go. We flew to Bucharest, and there has never been a wheelchair waiting for me so I guess they do not do that there. My last three trips with AF/KLM have resulted in delayed suitcases of up to a week.

After struggling to find room to store my luggage I had to squeeze my way up and ask the flight attendant for assistance. She told me “you need to figure that out yourself” along with “I don’t know how to help you”. I kept telling her that I wasn’t able to find bin space and that I needed help moving stuff out of the way (I’m 4’11 I can barely reach the bins) along with lifting my suitcase into a bin but she kept saying “you need to figure it out on your own”.

Air France,"I recently booked a round-trip flight from Zurich to Antananarivo with Air France, and the experience was nothing short of a nightmare. From start to finish, it was a series of mishaps and poor service that left me deeply stressed and unsatisfied. The outbound flight from Zurich was delayed by more than 30 minutes. This delay put us in a precarious situation, and we were forced to rush to catch our connecting flight at Paris CDG. The stress of almost missing our connection was certainly not the ideal way to begin a vacation. On the return journey, the problems persisted. The flight from Antananarivo to Paris CDG experienced another significant delay, causing us to miss our initial connection to Amsterdam. While we were rebooked on a later flight, the flight from Paris CDG to Amsterdam was delayed by 30 minutes. In an attempt to ensure we caught our connection in Amsterdam, we requested assistance from a flight attendant, only to be met with a disrespectful attitude and a dismissive response. Upon arriving in Zurich, the troubles continued as our luggage was nowhere to be found. Three of our bags were stuck in Amsterdam, and one in Paris CDG. We were left waiting for over 2 hours and 30 minutes for our luggage from Amsterdam to arrive in Zurich. This was particularly distressing because two of us had another flight scheduled for the following day and were uncertain whether our luggage would make it in time. As a result, we also missed our train connection from Zurich Airport to Thun. To top it all off, the in-flight meals provided by Air France were subpar at best. On the way to Antananarivo, the tomato salad had a rotten taste, and for a 10-hour flight, the meal options were shockingly limited. On the return journey, the meals were disappointing, with the second meal consisting of bread with some sauce, a cold mini croissant, a jam, and a yogurt. In summary, my experience with Air France on this trip was marred by delays, unhelpful staff, lost luggage, and inadequate in-flight meals.  I expected better service and reliability for the price I paid, and this experience fell far short of those expectations.","delays, unhelpful staff, lost luggage"
Air France,"Horrible experience ending in a canceled flight. We boarded on time at 3.30pm for a 4.05pm departure from BEY to CDG, and shortly after pushing back we were informed of a technical problem. We returned to the gate and were told one hour later that it was fixed. However shortly after pushing back again, the pilot announced the problem was still not fixed and that the plane's radar was out of order. We were then offered to fly to Athens as the weather there was good and didn't require a radar. Another AF flight would then take us to Paris. However half the passengers decided to leave the plane. I decided to stay but after more than 5 hours, we were still stuck in the plane with no food or drink served. Then the pilot said the flight was canceled because the weather had changed! A hostess started shouting at us with conflicting instructions about disembarking and then returning to our seats - a complete chaos with children crying. After disembarking it was a total mess a no one knew on which flight they would be rebooked. We ended being sent to a cheap hotel at midnight. It was impossible to get any help from AF's call center as it is based in North Africa and their totally useless staff were not even able to provide accurate information (they said there was no flight before 2 days later while I managed to get a booking the next day by talking directly to the airport staff).

Only one hot meal was served after take off (despite the 14-hour flight duration due to Russian airspace restrictions). A small bag with candies and fruit juice was served before landing, unlike some full service carriers who serve two full hot meals on such long flights. No power socket, only USB plugs - quite unacceptable for Premium Economy. No wifi. The crew did the bare minimum, they served the meal then disappeared for 11+ hours before serving the arrival refreshment. The IFE is ok. Air France packages itself as a luxury airline but in reality it is well below the competition.",Only one hot meal was served
Air France,"I was flying from Mumbai to London with a layover in Paris. First of all, they let us know that the flight from Paris to London was cancelled. Then, they decided to rebook our entire journey but instead of leaving at 2am, they wanted us to leave at 10am and stay in the airport uncompensated. In fact, we couldn't even speak to anyone about this. They provided us with a customer service number, but it had been closed for 2 hours. After scrambling around the airport for hours, we found someone to speak to who managed to get us on the original flight and a new flight leaving from Paris, with a delay of 2 hours. However, due to the change they moved our seats and due to this move, our vegan meals were also unavailable. Finally when we arrived to London, after waiting an hour for our suitcase we have been notified that it was lost. All the while without being able to speak to anyone on customer service.",vegan meals were also unavailable
Air France,"I booked this flight in November 2022 as part of a round world trip, as in my 70's I like a little comfort, I also booked an isle seat. Upon checking in at CDG , I was told I was on standby having paid 8 months before. It was an anxious 2 hour wait, I did get my premium economy seat, but not an aisle as requested and paid for, no fun on a 10 hour flight in a middle seat.",I was told I was on standby
Air France,"Flight to CDG was ok. Had bought a upgrade to business class during check in which included access to the lounge. Things got suspicious when the receptionist in CDG couldn't find my booking. He allowed me to enter the lounge regardless, where I spent the five hour layover. Upon boarding, I was told that the flight was overbooked and I was downgraded to economy. Got a an aisle seat when I had paid for a window seat when booking. While Air France downgraded me, they don't refund automatically. I have to apply for it and the money has yet to arrive. Food was edible at best. Cabin was very dated, duct tape was visible on seats. TV screen on the bulkhead seat couldn't be kept in place on the 14h flight, rendering it useless. The ticket in economy costed 1800 Euro and I'll spend this money with a decent airline next time.",they don't refund automatically
Air France,"Disappointing Business Class Experience on Air France. My wife and I recently flew with Air France in business class from Rabat to Manchester, with a connecting flight in Paris. Overall, it was a very disappointing experience that did not meet our expectations. On September 28, we boarded our flight from Rabat to Paris. The business class seats were barely an upgrade from economy, with limited recline and lacking amenities. The meal service was lacking - a small cold pasta salad and no appetizer or dessert. Upon arriving at CDG, there was no priority boarding or fast track security for business class passengers. We waited in a long queue for 35 minutes to board our connecting flight to Manchester. Again, the business class meal was mediocre - a small cold sandwich. On our return journey on October 1, we decided to fly economy class. Our flight from Manchester departed 15 minutes late. We were anxious about missing our connection in Paris due to the delay. The food was disappointing. Our flight landed in Paris 25 minutes late, giving us under 40 minutes to catch our connection to Rabat. We rushed through the airport and reached the gate just in time. However, upon landing in Rabat, we were informed that our checked luggage had been left behind in Paris. We had to return to the airport at 11:30pm when Air France sent the bags on a later flight. Overall, Air France's subpar seats, lack of amenities, mediocre food, and mismanaged baggage handling made this a terrible experience.  I would not recommend flying Air France, especially in business class, based on this disappointing trip.",checked luggage had been left behind in Paris
Air France,"We had to attend a family wedding in Kinshasa and travelled as a family group. The flight was delayed and we were stuck on the tarmac for 3 hours with no adequate food or drinks. Truly awful experience. Then they lost our bags containing clothes and gifts for the wedding. The bags arrived 3 days late damaged. They have not compensated us for the damage! They had a major server breakdown and communication via the website was impossible. We were told they lost 15,000 bags that day. The office in Kinshasa could not access any systems to register our loss but told us they would register on our behalf. Then once the process began back in the UK they would not process our claim without our bank details and then transferred a minimal amount without our consent. They said that when we gave our bank details we accepted their offer. Untrue! It has been a nightmare! We have tried to be reasonable but have been met with complete indifference.

Air France,"Copenhagen-Paris-Zurich-Paris on 17-18 Sep 23 deploying A220-300 and A320 aircrafts. Had to position myself in Zurich to catch my Kenya Airways (AF-codeshare) from there to Nairobi and Jo-burg. Tricky to check-in the luggage from CPH for the entire trip but by jumping the Zurich part, the luggage could be tagged simpler and eventually made it the whole way (5 legs) to Jo-burg. While Zurich became just a turnaround point with the same aircraft the return leg, however, was in business class: a clear step beyond economy, though identical, modest seats. The check-in in CPH went well but the handling agent deployed by Air France were rigid and uninterested and refused to transfer my luggage beyond the first 2 legs which caused me immense trouble and rebooking in ZRH as I could not catch my onward flight. The timeslot became too narrow to retrieve and recheck in luggage which I already informed of in CPH, but in vain: “we don’t do transfer on different tickets” despite being the same airline and even on the same (returning) aircraft. Lounges provided as elite traveller were fine in all three airports. Onboard, crew were courteous and effective. The A220 is a blessing, likely the best narrow body aircraft I have flown. All flights were clean, punctual or early. Service on board very modest, but a few drinks, hot drinks, and snack provided. Huge adavantage being elite FFP-traveller these days accessing their newer lounges and getting other perks.",The A220 is a blessing
Air France,"The quality of Air France is disgraceful to the point I won't fly any sky alliance flights again. We were flying back to Johannesburg for our wedding and so wanted the experience to be slightly more special. Paid for an upgrade to business class at the airport for Paris to JHB. Firstly, we received better drinks service in economy coming back than going out in business class. After our boarding drink was poured and we were in the air I asked if I could get a drink, twice, to once be told they would be with me soon, and when we were still ignored my partner then asked for a whiskey and he was told you can wait till after dinner. I understand that if you have been drinking prior to your flight and appear intoxicated, then you are not going to be served. However, we had just gotten off of our flight from Edinburgh to Paris which we had not drunk on. This flight was delayed. We were unable to make use of any of the time in the airport lounge which had been included in our flight upgrade, so hadn't had anything to drink during our time through CDG either.  Also, this doesn't even include WiFi. Secondly, at check in we were unable to upgrade on our return as the flight was full. When I discussed the delay on our last flight and our missed opportunity to utilise the lounge included with our previous upgrade she shrugged and said she didn't know and I should ask someone else. The food was bad with no in flight options provided. Only veggie, with both main and side vegetables overcooked. There is zero quality for the economy class customer experience which is ironic considering they were the most expensive of the three airline options between us and our guests who either flew British Airways or Qatar. We paid (not including our upgrade) £650 per adult return in comparison to £600 for BA and £500 for Qatar (all EDI to JHB). And again, despite being the most expensive, this included no checked baggage. Finally, my decision to never fly Sky Team again was cemented when I realised that I had not packed my toothpaste into my hand luggage on the economy fight back, so asked a stewardess if I could please have some to brush my teeth. Initially she told me they don't carry any toothpaste on board. When I didn't walk away she finally agreed that yes they do have toothpaste on board in the Business class flight bags but these are only for business class.",we were unable to upgrade on our return

Air France,"Both flights were on-time. DXB-CDG, plane was packed. Snack box was served right after take-off. An hour before landing, hot breakfast was served with tea and coffee and plenty of drinks run. CDG-YUL, gate and terminal was changed 2 hours before flight time, so I had to run from one end of the airport to another. AF customer service person told me its not an airline's decision when it comes to gates or terminal, airport management make a decision given the circumstances. Montreal flight was full and so much hand luggage passengers had that they had to move econ hand luggage to the business class section. Crew was kind enough to find me a place at the very end of the aircraft even though I was sitting in the front. Lunch was served then the snacks just before landing. At the back galley, plenty of snacks and drinks were available and few passengers decided to hang out there until landing so that was fun, get to know a few fellow passengers.

Air France,"Paid high price for ticket to get best connection. Delayed in Paris, very poor communications and moved gates multiple times. Delayed 2 hrs and not even a drink of water.  First time on Air France and wouldn’t bother again. Seems disorganised in their processes eg chaotic boarding.",very poor communications
Air France,"14 hours flight with no food or water during 11 hours! We were served a meal 30min into the flight and then left starving and thirsty for another 11 hours, there was another light meal just before we landed but, in between meals not only once the trolley passed by offering water, coffee or a simple cake. I was shocked! I had travelled previously from Paris to Bangkok through Thai Airlines and had a completely different experience. We had 2 meals and other 2 or 3 snacks in a shorter flight. Ground work wasn't better. Having taken about 1 hour to drop a bag already checked in through the self check in machine.",no food or water during 11 hours
Air France,"Other than the temperature on our flight, the flight itself was okay. My baggage has been lost for a month and Air France knows nothing. Frankly, they aren't even trying. It is always someone else's fault or they will call me back or some other excuse. Any time I call, you would think its the first they have heard of the issue. I understand that this is more important to me than it is to Air France, but at some point you would think they would try. I have very little hope I will ever see my belongings again or any compensation. No answers, no possible solutions.",baggage has been lost for a month
Air France,"I am pleased to say that for the first time, I am able to offer a positive review for Air France. On our flight out we were crammed into an Embraer 190, but the service was excellent and the in-flight meal had a choice of two options. On this return leg, there was a great deal more space because the seating was three by three and the middle seat was left empty. This is the way in short-haul European Business Class. The seats are the same as economy with the middle seat vacant. On both legs the cabin crew were excellent and the food was tasty and well presented. No problems with the airline, the airport, as usual, was utter madness. But that is another story.",service was excellent
Air France,First of all boarding was chaotic. The stewards speak Spanish poorly and English even worse. So you are forced more or less to give your best french. They give during the 10 hours 40 minutes flight less than a liter of water or any other kind of fluid and when you ask they give you paper mini cups of water. And you almost have to beg them. They only give two times something to eat. They last food round what's less than an hour and a half before landing of the flight so you have no time to eat properly because they barely give you your food and they already come to pick it up. They advertise to have Wifi on board but once on board sorry but no Wifi.,give two times something to eat
Air France,Horrible customer support and ground service. We had two delays that cost us an extra ticket and a stayover at the airport since we missed our connection. My friend received a compensation but my claims have been closed. No email provided to contact and no new claim can be made from the site since it refers to the first one (even though it's been closed). No response over the phone. I would definitely not book with them again.,not book with them again
Air France,"I didn’t know what to expect of Air France, but they really exceeded my expectations in this flight. The Premium Economy cabin on the 787 has very confortable seats. The IFE has plenty of choices, and the free wifi worked suprisingly good. Food was good, (though I still find out KLM or TK catering slightly better on Economy). However, what I liked the most was the onboard staff. They were outstanding, very friendly and helpful. The only downturn on this flight was that my luggage was delayed, being a tight conection time a factor for this incidence. After 5 days it could be sent to Querétaro Airport. While they handled the issue professionally, I have seen in other reviews this is a common issue in AF, so I would only use this airline again for direct flights, or flights with more than 3 hours of connecting time.",really exceeded my expectations
Air France,Plane had over 2.5 delay. They let everyone on the plane and after one hour waiting the captain decided to give an update that they had technical issues.

Both updates were in French and English were of the English was hardly understandable. Crew had no idea what was going on.,no idea what was going on
Air France,"Boarding on time. Warm welcome onboard. Plane was spotless. Air France, as usual, middle seat was empty so plenty of room in economy.

Food quantity and quality was superb; butter, cheese, French dessert. It would be nice if the bread roll was warmed up a bit before serving. IFE is ok, need a bit more diversity when it comes to TV/Films, though music collection was plenty. Lights were off after lunch, many passengers took an opportunity to sleep. Washrooms were kept spotless throughout the flight and back galley was well-equipped with little snacks and candies and drinks. An hour before the landing, snack box were distributed consisted of hummus sandwich, yogurt drink, muffin and coffee/tea.

Air France,"I checked in online and arrived at the Pierre Elliot Trudeau airport 45 minutes early to upgrade to business /or/ first class depending on availability. I was so happy to see all 3 agents working in Priority check in free. No customers to serve. I approached one agent, she asked to see my ticket which I showed her. I told her I want to upgrade. She replied, with a stern look, and said come back at 7. The time was 6.15 pm. She would not listen to anything I said thereafter ignoring me as though I did not exist. Another client arrived who was scheduled on an earlier flight, she allowed him to check in an extra luggage for free. I responded by saying that was such a nice gesture on her behalf, and it would be appreciated if that kindness spread to others like me....to please give me a solution. No response. I went to the next agent who was a little more helpful and told me to try the upgrade on the machine. (Even though there were no other customers to serve). I went to the self-operated check in machine and succeed to find the seats I wanted but it would not accept any credit card and redirected me to the counter. I went back, again all 3 agents were free. They said they cannot help. I became angry. Another client came with the same situation. Yet that client had already her business class tickets. She was treated the same way. She said she had “never” seen such service. Ok now its 7pm. I am waiting to enter priority check in-no one is there to serve the clients! The economy class is whizzing by, the ones in “Priority are waiting to be served. I approach the second agent I see walking by to ask her what is going on? Clearly, I was very upset. Rather than answer me she threatens to call security! Are you for real? She claims not to like my “tone”! Question: Air France: Why are you putting agents such as these in “Priority” check in? Please I need to understand! I am on a seven-week European vacation with my husband. I was so happy and then this? Do your clients happiness matter to you? Finally, I wanted their names which they completely refused to give, therefore I photographed them so that you can identify these rude agents and retrain their customer care service skills, or better yet give them a job that they do not have to deal with people. Clearly they are unhappy people who should not be greeting happy travellers. I am so disappointed with the service at the check in counter at YUL airport! The rest of our trip was excellent!",disappointed with service at check in counter
Air France,"Check-in was a bit confusing (airport is going through some big renovations, I guess not AF fault). Boarding was on-time but the plane had to wait for something on tarmac for almost an hour. Pilot made bilingual announcements regarding the delay though the English-version was incomprehensible. He even made mistake regarding the destination we are flying to (Paris Orly rather than Paris CDG, though crew rectify the mistake). Crew was very polite and smiley (as always with AF). Once airborne, we were served drinks and coffee with a small cookie. It was perfectly adequate for such a short flight. We landed 45 minutes late.",perfectly adequate for such a short flight
Air France,"I flew on Air France from Atlanta GA July 7th to Casablanca Morocco via Paris. They lost my bag between Paris & Casablanca. I called their Customer Support line. They never found my bag. I called frequently to no avail. Air France couldn't or wouldn't call Casablanca for me. They gave me # for Casablanca but no one spoke English. I was never reimbursed for new clothes I had to buy or contents of my bag. I'm out several hundred dollars because of this. I had 1 pair pants, 1 t-shirt & tennis shoes. It was 113° out. I was on a tour so not much time to get other clothes, shoes, toiletries, etc. I got no help from Air France at all. It was a horrible experience. Our guide even tried to help to no avail.

Air France,"Checked in online, only to receive half of my boarding documents, namely, the leg from Paris to the US. For the first flight from Lisbon to Paris I had to stand in line for over 40 minutes so that they would print it! And it seems they did the same thing to many US bound passengers. What is the point of all those prechecks, scanning passports into apps and phones, checkin in online, if we all end up standing in lines, with no bags to check? They first line you up in the middle of the hall, I guess so that others would stumble over you when rushing to their lines, and then open 3 out of 6 announced windows.

Lounges in both departure airports are very good: In Zurich, a separate Skyteam lounge is small, but boutique like with great offerings. In Paris, AFs Salon Lounge (T2 Hall F), is huge and does the job: I had a full breakfast and a nap. I was, without request, offered champagne while seated. Both flights briefly on time. Onboard services were very decent for economy with wine, drinks and snacks.

Air France,"Boarding was fast and smooth. Nice warm smiley welcome on board. Aircraft interior looked not that clean and shows its age well. IFE was excellent, so were the crew members, though it seemed at times that they were rushing the service. I pre-ordered Indian vegetarian option and I was served. Crew came over again for the drinks and when I asked if they have anything diet, one of the crew member actually went out of his was to find me a coke zero. Washrooms were kept clean through out the flight. Breakfast was adequate. I was really impressed how attentive crew were to one passenger who wasn't feeling good and vomit almost the entire flight. Overall, as expected, well served and fed flight.",Nice warm smiley welcome on board
Air France,"After an 11 hour flight, then a 6 hour layover in Paris, Air France rejected my boarding pass when scanned for boarding telling me the flight was full and a group of passengers were to fly on the next day's flight, on a ticket and prepaid seat they were fully paid for in advance. I had to spend the night in Paris airport hotel and wait for the next day's flight to Yerevan. Air France without notice to it's passengers' to increase their profit margins had decided to fly a smaller plane to Yerevan on July 25th, without having concern for leaving their passengers and their luggage behind. Air France supervisor finally after all their passengers had boarded showed up without apology threatening the furious passengers with police. Fortunately the French police was more civil than Air France supervisor, they stayed out of Air France dirty laundry and left them to sort the mess. Finally when some of the passengers were given seats their carry on luggage was checked in and the checked in luggage left behind. Without compensations a claim was filed on their site but the site did not allow for a delivery address. Two days later AF called telling me I had to pick up my luggage at the airport when I had included a primary residence address on the claim. Apparently I had not provided a local phone number and my international cell phone number was not acceptable for a local delivery. When contacted the Local Yerevan Air France office the sales desk agent was just as loud and rude as the supervisor in Paris. Not once they showed remorse for their lack of professionalism or showed customer service. I presume Air France agents are trained in finding obstacles instead of solutions, Have no concern the stress and health risk they pause to the passengers with their irresponsible behavior, pass the buck and scream loud to silence the exhausted passengers instead of listening. The ordeal is exhausting and Air France conduct and lack of customer service is unacceptable.",lack of customer service is unacceptable
Air France,"I will never ever pay Air France another dime after this humiliating flight. I'd rather go crawling on my face. On the way to the plane from Paris to Oran has not been cleaned between the previous passengers leaving and us boarding. So it was dirty and when I asked the flight attendant for wipes to clean it, she refused very rudely and told me, if you want wipes, get them yourself. Their hub is in CDG where we had to transit long enough that we left the airport and when we came back, I got pulled aside so that my carry on luggage gets weighed. Something that did not happen in Helsinki. Obviously most people have more than 8kg between backpack and carry on and was forced to pay 50€. This is only the case for Air France flights, as other flights went through other security lines. On the way back from Oran, they made us throw away liquids bought at the gates post security.",the plane from Paris has not been cleaned
Air France,"The food and service in business class was horrible. For the dinner flight we were served a tasteless, overcooked and fatty piece of pork and the next morning the staff on the left side of the aircraft failed to serve several business class passengers, including me, our breakfast! Instead they stood in the front of the section talking to people and then cleaning up their trays before the rest of us had even been served! During the flight they never came around offering us any water. We had to go the galley and request it.",service in business class was horrible
Air France,"I booked 2 business class tickets for myself and my 2 year old daughter. A few weeks before my flight, I called Air France to check on the seating and meal arrangements for my daughter to ensure everything is confirmed. The 2nd time I called Air France was the day before my flight to make sure again if the seating and meals were confirmed. Both occasions, I was given the assurance that my daughter's child meal was confirmed and for seating, it is a priority she is in the appropriate seat next to me. During the flight, the attendant came to me and said the child meal was not booked when I did it 2 times. The 2nd issue is my seat was faulty.  I only realized when I was extending the seat, that it jammed and couldn't become a bed. I got off to check and saw my daughter's foot was stuck in this big gap as you see in the picture, by the metal piece stretching across the seat. This piece was visible and the cushion was falling off. I called the attendant and she quickly informed the chief steward who came and pulled the cushion away to seal it back to cover the metal piece.  Throughout the flight, the cushion kept sliding and I had to get off the seat to refit the cushion. Before landing, I couldn't fully recline the seat back to original position because of this big issue. The attendant had to put in a lot of strength to ensure the cushions fit correctly while reclining the seat. Finally it went back to original position but the belt was stuck and I couldn't pull it to secure myself for the landing. I had to sit on my daughter's seat with her on my lap for the landing. I filed a complaint to Air France, I wanted to cancel my return flight to book on another airline. This is what they responded. Thank you for your remarks concerning the special child meal you booked and your seat on your flight from Marseille to Singapore on July 10. Our staff reported that you were unhappy with your seat and inspected the seat. They found no defect or fault with the seat, for which reason I cannot issue any compensation in this case. There are no reports on our system indicating that the special child meal was not delivered. For this reason, I cannot respond favorably to your request. We look forward to serving your travel needs again in the near future and to welcoming you aboard another of our flights.",I wanted to cancel my return flight
Air France,"This was my first time flying on Air France business class product and it was nothing short of spectacular. The airplane has been in service for 21 years but extremely well-kept. The business class used on this particular aircraft was the extra legroom seats section in the very front of the aircraft, so the row had three seats, but the middle seat was not sold so it was the aisle seat and I had the window seat. The flight lasted under two hours however, the proper business cabin service was still offered. A cold towel pre-flight, and a full gourmet meal as soon as we reached cruising altitude. There is absolutely nothing to complain about, we left on time and arrived on time. Great job Air France! Merci!",There is absolutely nothing to complain about
Air France,"I am extremely impressed with the business class product on this international flight. The airplane has been in service for 24 years, but extremely well-kept. We had an hour delay due to a technical issue with one of the navigation instruments however Air France allowed us to stay in the terminal and not on the plane, something that I extremely appreciate. I was very disappointed, however, with fellow business class passengers for giving the crew a hard time because we were late due to the fact that they were trying to fix one of the navigational instruments. Really? You get upset because the delay is a safety issue that they are trying to fix before we take off on a 9 hour flight? Thank you Air France for ensuring that safety came first. I would have gladly waited as long as I had to! Once up in the air, the business class service was nothing short of stellar, the meals were all gourmet by a three star, Michelin Chef, the in-flight crew was warm, welcoming, personable, and genuine. I have to say that after this experience, the business class product on Air France for me, comes in at number 2. Qatar obviously still holds the 1st place for me. This airplane had been upgraded to the new business class configurations 1-2-1. I had a window seat (7A) and even though overall, I am not a big fan of the new “business class pods” industry wide, the seat was very comfortable with plenty of storage, and the entertainment options were very good. Amenity kit, headphones, a very nice pillow and duvet were also offered in business class. One thing I loved about Air France is that they give you free Wi-Fi to send text messages via ‎WhatsApp, Messenger, iMessage, and a few other messaging platforms, so you really do not need to purchase an Internet package unless you want to stream. The Internet on this flight worked from gate to gate without interruption of service. Overall, next time I go to Europe, I will most definitely have Air France on my top list. They are offering a business class product that the rest of their competitors in this market are not. Merci Air France for a safe and wonderful experience onboard! I'm a fan!",business class service was nothing short of stellar
Air France,"Air France is a terrible airline with deceptive advertising and unresponsive customer service. We remain without fair compensation ($100 offered off a future flight). They made a significant change to my flight itinerary that I deem as an unfair or deceptive practice. The departing inflight entertainment service did not work for all three passengers. We were not informed until the flight was in the air, or we would have re-booked with a proper flight. Furthermore, I purchased these tickets with the promise that we would be served the menu prepared by Chef Mashama Bailey (our co-chef through the James Beard Foundation), but I received horrid food that was still frozen, not her menu or as advertised. Additionally, the staff lied numerous times when questioned if the food was vegetarian, they said yes – only to come back and inform me that they served eggs with chicken. We are strict vegetarians, which caused harm. On the return flight from Paris to JFK, again, I purchased the beauty of an Air France flight with all of its luxury and had a significant change of my flight itinerary that I deem unfair or deceptive practice to a Delta Flight. This flight lacked the services, food by Chef Mashama Bailey (or the Delta Business Class menu – we were served the economy class menu), wine, airplane, and staff that was purchased. The food, wine, flight accommodations, and staff were significant changes to the flight itinerary. This was terrible! This was my elderly mother’s last international flight, and your team should be ashamed for their lack of service, deceptive and unfair practices, while not fulfilling services purchased on this flight.",unresponsive customer service
Air France,"I would like to express my dissatisfaction with my recent flight experience with Air France. Unfortunately, my trip was marked by a significant delay, inadequate accommodations, and disproportionate treatment regarding the weight of my carry-on baggage. First and foremost, my flight experienced a 2-hour delay, which resulted in a missed connecting flight at CDG to AJA and disrupted my plans. The lack of effective communication and frequent updates on the flight status only exacerbated my frustration and discomfort throughout the waiting period. Furthermore, the accommodations provided by Air France were extremely disappointing. The hotel where I was accommodated was of inferior quality, with poor conditions and lack of air conditioning. The unbearable heat made my stay even more unsatisfactory and affected my rest before continuing with the journey. Lastly, I would like to mention the excessively strict attitude regarding the weight of my carry-on baggage. I was surprised by a severe reprimand from the airline staff due to just 700 grams over the limit in my carry-on bag, even though it was the same bag I boarded with in MUC. This disproportionate approach and disrespectful treatment left me extremely disappointed with the service provided. As a customer, I expected a comfortable and professional flight experience, but unfortunately, Air France did not meet my expectations. I request that you review your customer service policies with the aim of preventing other passengers from going through similar experiences in the future. As a result of this negative experience, I categorically state that I do not intend to fly with Air France again. I hope that this situation will be treated seriously, and appropriate measures will be taken to remedy the situation.",Air France did not meet my expectations
Air France,"Definitely worst experience checking in and on boarding. I came 2 hours before the flight, they had a very long line to check in. I went to the security, and after waiting a very long time to pass, they stopped me and measured my carry on, claiming it was 2 kilos over the 12 kilo limit. They sent me back to check in my carry on bag. I went back to check in and they just closed the check in saying I cant check in the luggage. They advised me to wear as much clothes as possible and try again... Horrible experience, never again Air France.",2 kilos over the 12 kilo limit
Air France,"Forced my to pay for my small hard shell bag and never made it. No one answers or emails you, had to spend days trying get my bag with all of clothes. Air France could care less and not following up on thousands of lost bags. They should have company taking these to travelers.",No one answers or emails you
Air France,"Absolutely terrible experience with this airline. I flew to Paris with my friend at the end of May and at the airport was informed that even though we paid and did everything correctly with the booking, for some reason tickets were not issued. They let us stay at the airport handing us a paper with contact for AF customer service, where after a longer wait they said they don’t know how to deal with the problem so they have to think about it - I guess not realizing we are under a time pressure and could miss the flight - already in pressure and missed the time we wanted to stay at the airport lounge. After some time, they came up with a solution - to pay for the tickets again, yes, double charge us (in fact it was a triple charge) and said the previous hold would be released within 3 days, which did not happen within the period of time, but in the end it did. They also did not disrespect our selected seat we had chosen in the booking and wanted us to sit separately and also let us wait the line at the counter again, even though we had already waited before and was denied because of the technical issue on their side. After this horrible experience I contacted the airline explaining what a terrible experience we had with them, however we were not asking for any compensation or refund. They replied in quite a long time saying they issued a refund. I was surprised that they actually acknowledged how much they failed, but it was sadly not the thing - for some reason they thought I was asking for a refund because of the previous hold payment, which I was not. That means they did not even read my complaint properly and after another week I received an email my refund was denied. So not even the customer service employees care about the complaints, they probably don’t even read it. This is the worst airline experience we have had so far and we have flown hundreds of flights combined. Thankfully there is a great competition in the European and world airlines market and it’s easy to avoid flying with this terrible airline, which also means avoiding their sister KLM (and whole skyteam) which have allied with this terrible company. Sorry not sorry!",the worst airline experience we have had
Air France,"First a comment about Premium Economy on Air France. It's a joke. I could have been just a uncomfortable in Economy for several hundred dollars less. Food service was indistinguishable from economy. The seat was a bit wider but only reclined two inches. The space under the seat in front of me where I would have liked to stretch my knee-replacement legs was bisected by the legs supporting the seat. The foot rest and leg support were no help. Cabin service first round was a 6 ounce cup of Coke with no ice. Next cabin service came seven hours later. Same thing. So much for Premium Economy. The real treat came when we arrived on Monday May 29 in Naples, Italy. Our baggage failed to make the trip. So we stood at the baggage claim office in line for an hour to get what is called a Property Irregularity Report. Meanwhile the driver who came to pick us up to drive us to Sorrento more than an hour away gave up on us and left. It took an international phone call to get him to return. We stayed in Sorrento until the morning of June 2 when we left for Rome. Our baggage finally arrived at the hotel 5 PM the night before we left. Four days without baggage. Air France did send an email with an apology for the inconvenience and admitted they were at fault for taking so long to return the bags. However the was no mention of anything that they would do to compensate for our inconvenience. Be careful when booking with Delta for international travel as they are cross listed with AF for many flights.",So much for Premium Economy
Air France,"This review pertains to their customer service when something goes wrong. They cancelled one of my flights. I had to scramble and take a train because I had all my vacation plans settled. I immediately filled out their forms while still in France. I spent two weeks of long hold times trying to get them on the phone. When I did, they made me fill out another form. I followed up using their messenger system which is a joke. It takes them 2 or 3 days to respond so the back and for of explanations takes forever. Messenger said it was refunded but couldn't tell a date or amount. I called again and they said it would take at least until July. This is absolutely ridiculous!",messenger system which is a joke
Air France,"Would definitely never fly again with Air France or Delta. 1) I got my ticket from Delta and upgraded later to Premium Economy. The email I got from Delta says that my second checked luggage is free from JFK to IST (see attached photo). Air France ground crew at JFK said that it is free only for JFK to CDG and that I had to pay for CDG to IST although my bags were going directly to IST after checking in. Delta should have informed better as their email was grossly misleading. 2) My Premium Economy seat footrest was broken. It was basically not there so probably people who sat at this seat put their feet on the back pocket of the seat in-front of me so that was also broken (see attached photo). For an upgraded seat that I paid extra for it was uncomfortable and not worth it. A cabin crew member came later and told me they will send me a discount coupon of 45 euros on my next flight ticket with Air France and that is the only thing that they can do. 3) On both ways in CDG transfer while going to the US and coming back from the US and flying to IST there is a security control with long lines. Getting just out of one flight trying to catch another and you are again stuck with a security control. Overall I am very unhappy with my choices and would probably never fly again with Air France or Delta. And probably direct flight from Turkey to US would be better because the CDG is also not very entertaining and has very little options due to terminals/gates in terms of services, shops, food and lounges. These tickets are not cheap even if they are not upgraded and still the service and aircraft are not up to the standards. And when you upgrade and pay extra hoping that you will get some rest and sleep the seats don’t function as per my case.",service and aircraft are not up to the standards
Air France,"After years of improvement, Air France is reborn in quality. Very poor food. Seat pitch on long haul is very poor but very good entertainment service, and very good lounge for those who have access. I was a great defender of Air France for years, I am much less. Après des années d’amélioration, Air France renaisse en qualité Nourriture très insuffisante Personnel autain Le pitch des sièges sur le long courrier est très insuffisant Mais très bon service de divertissement et très bon lounge pour ceux qui y ont accès J’étais un grand défenseur d’Air France depuis des années, je le suis beaucoup moins",Air France is reborn in quality
Air France,"Personnel attitude make the difference. On the way to Paris (see previous review) , everything went smoothly. Not on the way back. One of the rudest boarding I faced. Unpolite staff. No smile, no education. It seemed that we were bothering the two ladies. We entered the aircraft at a high level of stress. Turbulences and stress cockpit did not help then.",Personnel attitude make the difference
Air France,"Very quick check-in, boarding, flight and luggage delivery. Free coffee and soft drinks as well as a nice madeleine. Smiling employees everywhere. Perfect option for the route",Perfect option for the route
Air France,"I was very happy with my overall experience. Staff was super helpful at the airport, not to mention the friendliness of the crew and captains onboard. On most airlines, the crew are either super salty or sickly sweet, and I would say this one was friendly and professional with authenticity. Flight was on time, arrived at CDG early, and all of our baggage made it to our final destination. I've flown with most airlines at this point, as I'm American and have to fly back home often to see family. I've had so many bad experiences with things not working properly, rude staff, unwillingness to help, unexplained cancellations, lost baggage, etc. This is one of the best flights I've been on. Spend a little extra to have the AF / Delta experience.",very happy with my overall experience
Air France,"I had a tight connection in Paris and knowing AF's tendency to lose luggage, I took a normal carry on bag. The guy weighing the bag was a real jerk and forced me to go check the bag. One would think that a simple one way flight without any connection would be easy enough, but apparently not. They are still searching for my bag; the problem is probably further compounded by the fact that the gate agent put somebody else's name on it. I am never flying Air France again - this was the final straw after many bad experiences and screw ups",the final straw
Air France,"Problems encountered during my trip on flight AF655 on April 14th from Dubai to Paris. Due to the health issues of the captain we had to make an emergency landing in Vienna, where we were disembarked by bus at Terminal 3 around 4 am. Upon arriving at the terminal an airport employee told us to go to the Air France counter at Terminal 1. At the counter, the hostess told us to go back to Terminal 3, where an Air France hostess would assist us. So we returned to Terminal 3 (after spending over an hour queuing at security) to once again find no Air France representative. I called Air France customer service multiple times, asking to be transferred to another flight (there were over 6 Vienna-Paris flights in the morning, including 3 Air France flights with available seats, as I checked on the internet). After being told that a seat was being reserved for me on the 10:05 a.m. flight, I was later informed that it was no longer possible but that I would be called back. I never received a call back, and despite my reminders, no solution or alternative was ever offered to me, nor was I kept informed. I spent over 10 hours in Terminal 3 during which time I was never contacted or met with an Air France representative, and I was never kept informed about the progress in resolving the issue. Five days later, I received a generic letter from Air France with vague apologies, congratulating themselves for doing their best to resolve the problem and minimize its impact on passengers.",I never received a call back
Air France,We traveled with Air France and had nothing but issues. We had a cracked screen in row 12L. The USB port was damaged and the Wi-Fi for the flight did not work. We landed in Boston on the evening of 15th May and waited for baggage claim only to not see our luggage. Staff told us to scan a QR code and fill it out. This is not customer service nor what they get paid to do.  Our luggage is still missing.,Our luggage is still missing
Air France,We flew Air France to San Jose via Paris for a 2 week holiday returning on May 5th The in flight service was terrible with poor food and the crew did not come round to offer soft drinks or water. On our return flight the pilot announced that the plane was “too heavy” to take off so he offloaded all the luggage and told us that representatives would be available to help us in Paris. We arrived 4 hours late and so missed a connecting flight to Manchester. They knew nothing about the luggage and accused me of lying when I said that our bags had been offloaded. 5 days later our suitcases have still not arrived and Air France seem reluctant to process my claim. They are difficult to contact and have now asked me to list every item in my suitcase (who knows that?).,suitcases have still not arrived
Air France,"I was not able to take this flight. I canceled and they told me because my flight was non-refundable that they would give me a credit. What they FAILED to mention was that if I accepted the taxes back from the flight, it would WIPE OUT THE CREDIT! So I lost $1800.00USD. I called and spoke to their customer service department. I was disconnected several times, dealt with people whom couldn't connect me with a supervisor, and in one instance dealt with an EXTREMELY RUDE individual who told me to go to the website and complain. I will NEVER FLY with this company EVER!!!",couldn't connect me with a supervisor
Air France,"All crew members were nice, good flight, no complaint there. The seats are not comfortable. The entertainment system is very poor in terms of choices and quality. Almost 1/4 of the headphones in our sector were broken. The table tray unstable. According to the wine list, we were supposed to have an aperitif. Forget it, the seat belt was on until they came with the meal. The dish labelled beef contained a sort of strong turkey, the potatoes not cooked enough. My wife choose vegetarian gratin - what you see is what you get. And you are supposed to cut these using wood cutlery.  For breakfast, too much sugar and a wrap with mashed meat including peppers. Nice with a coffee. You will not see me again, well done.",seats are not comfortable
Air France,"Full flight, delayed departure due to strike, arrived almost on time though. Seat was a bit small due to 2-2-2 arrangement which is a little bit inappropriate for this type of aircraft. Service was exceptional, the attitude of the cabin crew seems to be the strength of Air France. Food was excellent, signature of known chefs.",Service was exceptional
Air France,"Flight on time, last minute gate change to one at the periphery of Budapest airport. Lounge too small for so many customers, not comfortable. The service in the airplane itself was excellent, very professional cabin crew, customer-orientated, food was delicious. Seat was uncomfortable though (normal Economy with empty middle seat). Mixed experience overall.",very professional cabin crew
Air France,"Punctual, good service with a cookie and drinks on this short 55 min flight. Flying on the 70 seater E170 made this flight less stressful, recommended","Punctual, good service"
Air France,"The most disgusting service I have ever taken. They charged $150 for 3 kgs extra without allowing me to change the staff to my cabin one. I asked for a refund hoping there will be some understandable humans behind the desk but they refused even that. A total disgrace and disappointment. Please people if you ever can avoid. They are over priced, no empathy, not understandable, scammers. Just avoid please.",most disgusting service
Air France,"My first long haul flight since COVID. It was a pleasure to travel business class with Air France. The cabin layout is 1-2-1 which was excellent. Service was impeccable as expected with them. Had a choice to pre-order your preferred meal before take-off. Seat was comfortable and good entertainment on board. My only surprise was that guava juice was not available, something that was unexpected considering this is a very popular drink in Guadeloupe.",Service was impeccable
Air France,"Avoid AF if at all possible. Arrogant & rude cabin crew and the worst food I’ve ever received in the class of flight. Starting point was the cabin wasn’t fully ready even when the aircraft doors were closed ready for push back. Finally offered a welcome drink and I requested a Perrier Water but it never arrived and was later informed that, on the French national carrier, there wasn’t any. Dinner arrived and was so poor in terms of quality that I opted for some packet biscuits & chocolate. Wouldn’t have said no to some crisps but guess what - there were none. Took for ever to get a cup of mint tea after the ‘dinner’ service as all bar one of the crew disappeared. The best that can be said about the breakfast meal is that at least the fruit was edible - just. At least the seat became a full flat bed but my advice is avoid Air France.",my advice is avoid Air France
Air France,"Two short hops with this full service airline providing indeed full service during flights. Nice to see AF not only claims to be full service, but also commits to it. On both flights drink service with little snack/sandwich. Pleasant crew and easy transfer in terminal 2G at CDG.",Pleasant crew
Air France,"Disappointing flight. A very old Boeing 777, seat configuration 2-3-2 in Business. Champagne and wine were nothing special. Food was the worst I had on a flight, my beef was overdone,  vegetables tasteless and cheese had supermarket quality! We arrived punctually and the crew was very friendly.",the crew was very friendly
Air France,"CDG terminal 2E, whilst spacious and clean, has a poor selection of food options, and expect to be subject to the slowest passport checks. Last call was announced before any passengers had boarded. The hidden queue had everyone standing in the air bridge for 45 minutes. Then once we finally all got seated we then sat on the gate for 1.5 hours to get an air traffic slot. No substance or apology.",the slowest passport checks
Air France,"Boarding was done efficiently with Sky Priority/Business passengers allowed on first. It was a nearly-new A350 and looked immaculate. We were greeted by enthusiastic cabin crew and shown to our seats. I have always taken the view that there is always at least one thing wrong with any business seat but not on this occasion. It was extremely well designed with an excellent screen, solid table, privacy, ample storage spaces and the ability to locate switches and power points without searching too hard. We were offered a glass of champagne, juice or water before takeoff and given a very impressively comprehensive menu. I had pre-ordered the fish and it was incredibly tasty and excellently served by the cabin crew. I chose the delicious Chablis which seems to work well at altitude. It is an overnight flight and after the meal lights were dimmed. Although it was a flat bed seat I always believed that one sleeps better if it is at a slight angle – especially as aircraft never fly exactly horizontally. Despite only a blanket and pillow I had one of the most comfortable nights ever on an aircraft. I was awoken from breakfast and shown the omelette. This, I knew, never works that well but it was still tasty and accompanied by bread and fruit. Throughout the flight the cabin crew were absolutely excellent. Every request was answered and they were friendly, funny at times, very French (of course) and a credit to the airline. I have been flying regularly since I was four years old and this was easily one of my best experiences – well up to the standard pioneered by the Middle East airlines.",cabin crew were absolutely excellent
Air France,"AF 072 flight from Paris Charles de Gaulle to LAX. US passport holders have an extra long line to weigh their baggage. The person weighing the baggage before this flight asked the passenger ahead of me in line to weigh her bags. When the bag was lower than the allowed weight, he asked her to put her shawl and jacket onto the scale. Then he shouted out ‘It is overweight, go and pay 100$ and check it in’.  I went twice through the line, after removing and throwing away some of my luggage the first time. The second time, he put a red tag and asked me to pay excess baggage. There were some people around the corner, who were in conversation with this person weighing the bags in French. They asked me for cash and told me I had to pay there to get my baggage on the plane. I gave them cash, and a woman then took me to a long line and left me with some strangers saying they will take me in with the luggage. I soon realized this was the line for Business class and I was on the wrong line. By the time I went to the baggage counter to pay for extra luggage, it was too late to check-in my bag as the time for that had lapsed. So they made me throw away most of my luggage to make it a carry-on. The next flight was only two hours away. They could have easily checked me into the next flight if they were only willing to be a little helpful.",too late to check-in my bag
Air France,"Short 1 hour flight that's perfect for people not looking for extreme budget options. Despite the relatively dated cabin interior (the plane took its first flight in 1999 according to a quick registration lookup), Air France more than makes up for it in convenience of a complimentary drink service (more than just water, but with hot and cold beverages), as well as some cookies as a snack. In addition compared to more budget options such as easyjet, AF's usage of jet bridges and the main CDG airport in Paris makes the journey overall much more convenient, as long as you don't mind spending a little more than budget offerings.",makes up for it in convenience
Air France,"I booked premium economy because I have knee problems. The seats are just OK (shell type that slides down but not built for a person over 6 feet), and the food is the same as economy, although it was the best fish I ever had on a plane. Overall, a very decent product, and the flight was on time. They lost my luggage, so I did not have winter clothing as it was summer in South Africa. I bought what I needed for €240 and Air France reimbursed me within 10 days. Overall, very satisfied and impressed by the no fuzz reimbursement.",a very decent product
Air France,"On time, in a quite comfortable seat in a duo at the back, with a wonderful clear window view, and a very informative real-time flight map. I was very lucky to book early, and paid a pittance while prices were on the floor, so good VFM. Air France is in reality operated as a budget airline, because, unlike Airasia et al, they don't sell tasty food on board. So my advice is bring a substantial picnic because, after an early lunch, you will get nothing to eat for 9 hours.  The hapless staff have nothing to offer, other than a friendly giggle or a rude dismissive shrug. Bring your own music and movies, unless you like French stuff. Don't ask cabin crew for your connection gate number, they have no interest in helping you",I was very lucky to book early
Air France,"Flight was two hours late leaving Lome. At check-in, I encountered the most grim looking row of agents I'd ever seen. I understand they had to stay at work longer due to the delayed flight, but that isn't my fault and I expect some smiles and basic courtesy when checking in, particularly on a costly business class ticket. After completing check-in, I noticed that my bag tag was completely illegible because the printer was running out of ink. I returned to the check-in counter where I approached an agent who appeared to be lead agent on duty that night. I asked him in French if my bag tag can please be reprinted as it was unreadable. He started yelling at me (in French), Who did you see when you checked in...go to that person. I stopped all proceedings and firmly responded, Why are you speaking to me like that!?. He then told me curtly that the bag had already been sent for loading onto the aircraft. I told him that I was well aware of how the baggage system works, but I had simply asked if my bag tag could be reprinted. He continued to give me rude responses, at which point I told him to go into the system and find my baggage tag number and write it legibly on my boarding pass. I then went to the Air France station manager's office and complained. Shameful treatment of a high revenue passenger. Flights were fine. Air France lounges in Paris should stock non-alcoholic beer.  Food on Paris-Washington flight way overcooked -- dried out and unappealing appearance. Crew was very attentive, however.",expect some smiles and basic courtesy
Air France,"A bad experience with Air France. During a 9-hour flight, I waited for an hour for a glass of water. During the connection flight, they remain without sandwiches. It is incredible that Air France has such a small standard.",A bad experience
Air France,"My business class flight fell well short of a four star carrier. The reasons for this were that pre departure drink glasses were left on the central arm rest during the take off from Bangkok, I had to hold mine down during take off. The cabin crew raced through the lunch service just after take off, then after this service the cabin crew closed the window blinds and I never saw them again until the second meal service, not once did they come around asking passengers if they wanted anything. The food quality was also poor. All take off and landing announcements from the cockpit were in French, not in English. The cabin crew manager talked to French passengers but never once spoke to me once during the flight. The 2-2-2 layout is outdated and was awful but that was my fault for choosing that specific flight. The second meal service was served too late before landing, so again it was rushed. The overall experience was very poor and I won't be in a rush to try it again.",overall experience was very poor
Air France,The plane was spotless and very well maintained. The service was very elegant and welcoming. Food was almost as good as in a good restaurant. I felt very welcomed on board. I will fly AF in C again for sure. It was a wonderful flight.,a wonderful flight
Air France,"Bad experience with special meals on board, it was not possible to change them on website or app and we had normal meal but we were not able to eat anything because we are allergic to dairies. Fortunately the cabin crew tried to help with some bread and side dishes. Contacting their help 24 hours before the flight was not useful at all.",the cabin crew tried to help
Air France,"Flown with Air France many times over the last 20-30 years. This flight was just a highlight about why we use Air France whenever possible. Cabin crew are very friendly, happy to have a conversation and make you feel very safe and comfortable on the flight. Short haul food is very good, and a wide range of free drinks including wine available to economy passengers is great. Luggage policies are very reasonable and it doesn’t cost much to add on extra bags or suitcases. Boarding was very efficient and both our flights were on-time. Highly recommend using AF, customer service is outstanding.",customer service is outstanding
Air France,"HAM to CDG and return. Two short hops of 70 min each. Purchasing ticket and options via AF app was a breeze. Same for online check in. All was easy, clear and working well. At both airports I used self-serviced bag drop-off. You come to the unmanned kiosk, scan your boarding pass, then it prints your bag tag, you attach it to a bag, place the bag on the belt, scan the tag and your bag is checked. At both stations it didn’t take me more than 3 minutes with zero queuing time. At the same time queuing to normal check in desks would have taken good 20 minutes (also quite bearable if you arrive on time). My first flight was delayed by 1 hour. The delay was managed perfectly. Push notification and email on the mobile phone with new estimated boarding time and gate number, instant update of the boarding pass via app and proper announcement at the gate. Inflight information on missed and rescheduled connections was sufficient and clear. In the air they have managed to serve small snack with round if drinks (tea, coffee, soda, beer, wine). I purchased inflight internet access. The price was ok, speed was fine for browsing websites. If you need just messaging you can get a free plan for the whole duration of your flight. Cabin was clean and fresh (brand new A220) with reasonable comfort. On the way back it was HOP (regional subsidiary of AF) with older E190. Embraer fleet have no onboard internet access, but otherwise they are more comfortable with wider seats and more legroom. Service standard was identical to AF mainline with super friendly and professional crews. HOP flights use 2G terminal at CDG which is a small regional terminal located afar from the main area where all big terminals are. It requires a separate bus ride in addition to rail or bus city link, so mind it and allow extra 20 minutes if you’re leaving from there. On my flight to Paris baggage was on the belt within 30 minutes after disembarkation, when in Hamburg it took around 20 minutes to deliver bags.",Cabin was clean and fresh
Air France,"Customer service on the phone were both incompetent and rude. Took 4 days of being told to call back in 24h and receiving no help. Every person we spoke to at the check in desk and ticketing sales was nasty. Air France customer service at LAX is awful, one older French woman at ticketing sales was aggressive in her rudeness. My partner and I will never fly Air France again, it was such an upsetting experience considering how much we paid.",never fly Air France again
Air France,"Our baggage did not make the destination airport. Air France told me initially that I will get them the day after (today) - which I have been told is no longer the case, right now I already expect them tomorrow. I live in the Czech Republic and I have spent 1 month in Spain. I had to take casual and business clothes with me, as well as gym clothes. As a consequence, I do not have clothes to work tomorrow, neither for my gym session. Additionally, I have my winter jacket in the missing baggage. Being in Prague and being in winter, I can not go anywhere without it. For this reason, I am going to buy at least some business clothes and gym clothes so I can make it through the day tomorrow. Air France does not want to compensate for any of the costs involved on this as they say I have a permanent, and not a temporary address. I do not care what the policy say, this is going to cost me money and make me waste time. Being such a well known company, I trusted Air France. The whole experience of missing a baggage starts on the airport, where you are waiting for longer as your bags do not come. Then filling all the paperwork on the baggage claim desk. Afterwards, having to call the company and waiting for customer service to answer so you can get to follow up your case with disappointment to hear that it is not going to make it on the right time. Followed by wasting time shopping things that you already have. How is possible that a customer can not be compensated for such a cost, waste of time, and bad experience?",baggage did not make the destination
Air France,"I arrived to Palma de Mallorca, Spain from San Francisco, California on September 23rd, 2022. I filed my missing baggage claim on the 30th of September, 2022 and presented receipts for some of the articles I had replaced within that time frame between my arrival and my request for compensation. I was awarded the money compensation I applied for and the Air France Customer Care Assistance said they would have the money wired to my bank account over the next several weeks. I haven't seen a penny of the compensation. I called Air France Spain yesterday and the representative reopened the claim for investigation into whether or not the payment was initiated or not or if I may need to provide additional bank account information. Instead of further investigation or engagement with me, I received and email stating that the claim was handled correctly and that no further correspondence with me would be continued based on this topic. So, in the end, I have received no compensation I was told I would receive and no follow-up was even considered. Now, I will turn to contacting their customer service via social media to see if I shall get a different result. Unfortunately, according to the email, it was one representative navigating my claim this entire time with no option to speak to the person directly in charge of discharging financial compensation. Be careful with your items with Air France and I recommend keeping more of your valuables and preferred clothing in your carry on bag. I lost a lot more than I can afford to replace on my Spanish income. I would share screenshots of the email in question but it is forbidden.",haven't seen a penny of the compensation
Air France,"The Manchester to Paris segment was very average with a very poor seat pitch but for a 1hr 20 min flight I could grin and bear it. However the Paris to Bangkok segment was excellent on all counts. The service provided by Aurelie Luche was outstanding, professional and ever so efficient and friendly. The food for the 11hour and twenty minute flight was plentiful and tasty. The overall comfort of the seat was not that outstanding but I have to say that what was my first flight with Air France it certainly won't be my last. Well done to the crew, especially to Aurelie.","outstanding, professional"
Air France,"Glitch with agent put me in regular window seat, instead of paid exit row. Although plane was near capacity, flight attendant went to great lengths to find me an aisle seat and overhead space for camera equipment. Just after take off, one of my ear buds became dislodged and fell to floor. I was not able to find it for duration of flight. After everyone else deplaned, I searched to no avail, and was about to quit the search. 3 flight attendants joined the search, and one of them found missing ear bud 4 rows behind my row. The pair retails for $250! I thanked her profusely, and offered to send her a photo gift. I hope she replies. This flight crew was very professional, positive and engaging.","very professional, positive and engaging"
Air France,"Wonderful flight. Extremely professional crew and delicious food. I didn't love the seat and found it a bit narrow compared to others, but didn't detract from the experience. Would recommend.",Wonderful flight
Air France,"A good return trip to PUJ in the Caribbean with AF from CDG. They have a very solid product. Good quality food -two services - and even champagne in economy which is a great classy touch. Cabin crew were immaculately presented on both legs and friendly and highly professional. Additional drinks on demand. IFE is not to my taste but I am not a big user of IFE. If there was any fault it would be the numerous announcements in English, French and Spanish which was a bit much. Also lights a bit bright at other times. Baggage handling and check in fine on both legs. A good solid product from a classic legacy carrier.",a classic legacy carrier
Air France,"Air France business class lounge in Zanzibar is non-existent! Air France in Zanzibar does not have a contract for its passengers to use the Business Class lounge so even if you have paid for a business class ticket, to use the lounge in Zanzibar airport, you will be told to pay USD $30. Air France knows that their business class passengers will not be able to use the lounge and they make sure not to advise passengers. You will make the discovery when you attempt to enter the lounge. When I contacted Air France for a refund, they told me that they are not responsible for business lounges outside of France! That’s called collecting money under false pretences!  I went online to request my gluten-free meal. I called Air France twice to confirm that the meals had been ordered. However, on the 8 hour flight from Paris to Miami, Air France forgot to provide a gluten free meal. So I enjoyed nuts and juices for the 8-hour flight. When I contacted Air France, they told me that they were sorry. No compensation for their error. The moral of the story - if you need a gluten-free meal in business class, take your meal on board with you! That's after you pay the business class fare of $3200!",No compensation for their error
Air France,Nice short trip on time. We were even served a sandwich and drink on a 45 min flight. Outstanding: due to train delay I arrived at airport just 40 min before flight. Pulled me through first and even baggage arrived.,Nice short trip on time
Air France,"Our flight in June 2022 was already late, and once in the plane and already moving on the ground in order to take-off, the crew detected a fuel leak,o we had to pass by technical control, while remaining in the plane. After having waited 1 hour in the aircraft with an obviously upset crew, they finally told us that this aircraft could not fly and that we have to wait in the airport for another aircraft to continue our journey. After waiting 2 hours in a very limited area, Air France announces that we can eventually not depart as we will land in Pointe-à-Pitre too late because there is a curfew. So we have to move in the main lobby to pre-check-in for the next day, but we have to wait again as they don't know from which airport in Paris we have to leave the following day. So the desk remains closed. It's already been 5 hours since the trouble started, and at last they provide us with a bottle of water. Nothing before. Everyone is getting very upset with the situation and waiting for Air France to organize our unexpected night in Paris, to finally hear : We will not take care of your accomodation and transportation, please make your own plans, we will reimburse you afterwards. The flight was in June, nothing has been reimbursed so far, and not even my request has been answered by October.",nothing has been reimbursed so far
Air France,"Air France Business Class Mauritius to Paris Boeing 777. Recent seats and good food but got the impression that the cabin crew forgot me. Meal selection was limited, forgot to serve me dessert. When asked it was served on the table without table cloth without any napkin. When asking for a napkin, I was given a large table cloth. For breakfast had to use the call button a few times to get an orange juice and another tea. Travelling is not only about cabin product seats and meals, you need to feel welcomed and pampered. This was not the case for Air France crew on this flight.",need to feel welcomed and pampered
Air France,One of the most comfortable Premium Economy seats. Brand new aircraft. Flights on time both outbound and inbound. Onboard staff very courteous and professional. Onboard Wi-Fi probably the best connection I have experienced in the air. The only downsize is the food. So far the worse even compared to an average economy class. Food was disappointing. If not for the food I would have voted 10/10.,Food was disappointing
Air France,"I will never fly Air France again and urge you not to if you have a choice. For reference, I previously worked for an airline, so I am very familiar with flying. First, for our first short flight our Viking Cruise got us to the airport 4 hours early (this was not Air France's fault), but Air France didn't open their ticket counter for another two plus hours, so we couldn't check in and had to sit with our bags in ticketing for a long time. On the long leg of our trip, the 8.5 hour flight, we didn't leave until about 30 minutes late (we were sitting on the plane) and then they didn't tell us until we'd already taken off that we wouldn't have internet for the flight. I did not pay 5k for my seat to not be able to contact my pet sitter or download a book for 9 hours. The also didn't have internet on a short leg on our way to Barcelona.",wouldn't have internet for the flight
Air France,"We got to CDG airport 3 hours before departure, and we had to run to catch the flight. Long lines, some counters were closed while the ground staff was chatting, no sense of urgency from anyone. The supervisor was less helpful than the others. When we landed at LAX, we didn't find our luggage, and AF personnel had no idea of where it was. It was left in front of the house door the following day without even ringing the bell. We found the bag broken and unrepairable and AF only reimbursed us for 15% of the value for a new bag, with no explanation.",reimbursed us for 15% of the value
Air France,"They have cancelled the flight 15 minutes before departure. They have booked me another flight without asking about my preferences at >than 48 h after the original one.

They seemed very bothered by the fact that I could have used some help.",cancelled flight 15 minutes before departure
Air France,"I had tried to upgrade from economy to premium economy online, but there was no availability. When I was already seating while the plane was about to leave, the flight attendant came to ask if I still wanted to move to premium economy and pay with my miles. This was a pleasant surprise and I enjoyed the extra space on this long night flight. The premium economy seat was comfortable and the service friendly.",comfortable and the service friendly
Air France,"An unreliable company, with careless customer service. My flight was permanently further delayed with nonsense announcements, culminating when Air France App claimed at 6h07 pm the flight was scheduled to leave at 5h15pm (see picture)! We finally left with 2h delay (for a 1h flight). No WiFi on board contrary to what was advertised before the flight and even on board. The cabin crew was unapologetic. No way to work or inform business partners at MPL of my scheduled arrival time. In-flight business meal consisted of nuts, one cookie, and a drink. I don't see the difference with economy. Finally arrived starved, late, having lost my business day. Despite Platinum loyalty status and flying business class, all this was considered not worth any compensation by AF customer service. I regret not having traveled by train.",regret not having traveled by train
Air France,"I was very fortunate to fly business with Air France, first Toronto to Paris, after being bumped by WestJet, and taking a flight a few hours later, which was excellent. Then even better was my flight Paris to Vancouver, with the lovely and very efficient flight attendant. I felt her performance alone deserved attention for how special it was. The food and wine was extraordinary, no request was too much, and I enjoyed getting to try to converse in French. I don’t write a lot of reviews, and I usually travel Star Alliance, but for Air France, I’ll gladly make exceptions going forward! I will see Air France in business again in April, to Paris and Lisbon, I cant wait!",The food and wine was extraordinary
Air France,"Very Smooth flight. Seat space is very comfortable for economy, 81 cm much more than others offer. Good entertaining and nice crew. Free champagne and a nice dinner with several courses free wines and a pre landing snack. Only the snack was bad and only dry bread. Delay one hour but arrived on time. Would fly Air France again.",Would fly Air France again
Air France,"New York to Stuttgart via Paris. I had a bad experience, on my flight from New York to Paris. Firstly everything was so uncoordinated, the flight got delayed, even the staff from the plane wasn’t in yet even though the boarding would be in 5 minutes. While we was flying there were many inconveniences. First the AC was so cold that I froze the whole time, secondly we flew at night (0:30) and people wanted to sleep but the lights from the airplane were fully on. It was a longer flight but we didn’t receive much to eat and when they came by with water, tea, coffee they didn’t asked me, just a few passengers.",everything was so uncoordinated
Air France,"London to Dubai via Paris. After being unable to make my journey and trying to rebook my ticket the customer service has been utterly terrible. They wouldn't offer a refund, instead offered to rebook and call back once the fees were calculated within 48hrs. This never happened, and when trying to check my flight details on the app and found there was nothing there - I called them back and was told my £825 ticket was cancelled. I have spent many days talking to various people over the phone having no clue, but at the same time scared to summon one of their supervisors who are always 'in a meeting' - it's been a month now. They now refuse to do anything about my tickets, constantly hanging up without offering any resolve, the outsourced call centre obviously doesn't care for the reputation of the Airline. I have never had this bad customer service with any airline regarding cancellations and rebooking/changing of a flight and I've been travelling to medical conferences and meetings for 50+ years. Unless you really have to, I would avoid this airline like the plague (I only took this airline based on my daughter's word and recent travel), they do not care for your custom, they don't even have any Air-France staff at the check-in desks in Heathrow.",call centre obviously doesn't care
Air France,"Flights cancelled at short notice, no rebooking options, no compensation. I had to buy a new ticket and it took them over 2 months to refund the previous one. Aircrafts were fine, service was standard for long haul. 3 pieces of luggage delayed for 75 days, no information from their customer service, hard to reach and rude. Worst experience with an airline, they'll never see me again.",took them over 2 months to refund
Air France,"My original flight had mechanical problems while in flight, so we diverted to Milan and endured hours of delay in getting to our final destination of New York-JFK. It was an awful ordeal. I submitted a delay compensation request back in January, and they finally approved it in September (more than 8 months to process!), but only for one of the two passengers in the reservation. I supplied them with all of the documentation they requested for both passengers. They have been unfriendly and unhelpful in getting to this point, and now after eight months of waiting, they are making me still fight them for the proper compensation amount. All I'm asking is that they follow the standard regulations set forth by the European Union. Nothing more, nothing less.",still fight them for the proper compensation
Air France,"Excellent service at Bengaluru. Due to the short time in b/w transfers one bag did not arrive. However Air France had already sent a list of missing baggage and they informed us whilst we were at the luggage carousel, this saving us time. They tracked where our baggage was and sent it on the next flight. It arrived safely. Very helpful staff at Bengaluru who helped us when we were tired and stressed. Thank you Air France! Re food though it's a different review as the quality was poor, food passed off as Indian, really wasn't food any Indian would eat!",Thank you Air France!
Air France,"Delayed baggage, and even longer delays (3 days!) in shipping it to me. Air France has scheduled far too short a connection time in Paris for its flights from West Africa (Guinea and Central African Republic), and given the change in terminal and slow security at CDG, I always end up having to run in order to make the final call for my London flight - very stressful. Air France themselves have the same problem - the last time I flew, my bag also missed the connection, and arrived in London three hours after me. That's when things really went downhill. Despite the fact that I live only two hours drive from Heathrow, it took Air France 3 days to ship my bag to me. I can order something on Amazon by midday and have it delivered the same day, but Air France takes 3 days to ship to an address two hours drive away. The final cherry on the cake: arrogant, indifferent customer service. When I called to complain about all of this and asked for a manager, the operator initially refused to let me talk to a manager, saying this was just about a bag. When I insisted, he said all of the managers were in a meeting, but he refused to get a manager to call me back - he said I would have to ring again and try to catch them when they're available! I will instead now vote with my feet, and stop using Air France for my flights to West Africa. Terrible airline.",it took Air France 3 days to ship my bag to me
Air France,"Excellent flight from Paris to Montréal, I wouldn't have recommended Air France 6 or 7 years ago, but this airline is really improving. The cabin crew was pleasing and careful, the flight landed earlier than announced and the food was pretty good for an economy class. The only negative point is that Paris CDG is really disorganized, it is probably one of the worst airports I've had experienced with Amsterdam AMS in Europe. I really hope that it will improve within the next years.",this airline is really improving
Air France,"My flight from Zurich to Paris was an hour late.  My return flight experience was worse: I paid for a Siège Plus (11D) with extra legroom. However, there were no such seats (no emergency exit seats) on the Embraer 170. I now have to spend time filing an online claim for a reimbursement. My baggage was not delivered in Zurich. This is not the first time my bags have been lost by Air France even in a tiny terminal like 2G in Paris.  The bag finally arrived at Zurich airport this morning, one and a half days late. The local transporter never contacted me to schedule delivery. I had to call AF and insist on getting the local transporter's telephone number. I was told the bag was on its way, despite the fact that nobody had called me to check if I was home. I was told it would be with me between 3 and 5 p.m. No bag arrived. I then called the transporter again, who checked and said the driver claimed I was not at home. Hello! I had stayed at home the entire day. I did not even take a shower in case the driver came with my bag at exactly that time. This was a blatant lie by the driver. I then insisted that they make a delivery and I now have another two interval I need to block in the evening. In the best case scenario, I will have spent my entire day waiting at home for a bag. Between AF and the useless local transporter, I have wasted two days. Is this how AF treats its passengers? Is a Flying Blue Gold member impressed by this experience? I am very frustrated by the utter lack of professionalism from start to finish.",frustrated by the utter lack of professionalism
Air France,"This was a booking with KLM for two passengers made and paid by myself but one passenger cancelled. I was promised a refund against a fee. The refund was never made. I asked various Air France employees if there was anything I could do to solve the situation.  It seems to me that niceties in the cabin are cheap to get, and anyway, those are paid for. When real issues arise, Air France is incapable of solving them, and, indeed, does not care to do so.",The refund was never made
Air France,"Outstanding service. I have travelled from OTP to JFK via CDG and return in business class. A great experience from the lounge, food, beverages to the comfort of the seat. On the return segment JFK -CDG I was upgraded in La Premiere due to my Platinum Ultimate status. The onboard service was state of the art. The champagne the best I have ever tasted. The FAs and the pursers attitude and service flow less. Looking forward to my next trip with AF.",Outstanding service
Air France,They stop passengers at security to weigh their carry-on luggage. They weigh both bags and if both bags are even 1KG over their 12 KG weight limit they make you walk back to the Air France check-in area to spend 110 euros and 25 minutes to check one bag (not both bags even though they were both weighed together). This would make sense if the luggage was oversized and didn’t fit in the overhead bins but our small luggage was overweight was because we travel with large books.,weigh their carry-on luggage
Air France,"I booked a flight for an Air France / Virgin Atlantic flight from Orlando to Beirut. Once I landed in Beirut airport I notice I'm missing one checked bag so I reached out to the missing luggage office and file claim. 2 days later I got update by email that my bag was found, and it will be forwarded to Beirut. I contacted airport for my bag, and they said my bag did not arrive. 2 days later suddenly the claim I filed in the airport was closed and when I contacted customer service, they didn't know how the claim was closed or who closed it. I filed online claim again, since then I have been calling customer service every day about my luggage with no updates. Nobody could explain how my first claim was closed and keep saying no update on my luggage. I filed claim for necessary purchase but I didn't get any reimbursement, then after 21 days filed claim for lost luggage. I started calling air France every day, I got to speak with supervisor who made clear your bag was lost and there is no way for passenger to talk to claim department unless they call you. I asked how long it takes to get my reimbursement, he said, we have long queue and this might take several months. So they lost my bag with promise they will reimburse me when they decide to do with no timeframe.",missing one checked bag
Air France,"We were able to fit everything into carry on luggage, which was helpful, especially outbound. On the return flight our bags were spot checked and found to be overweight so we had to get out of the line for passport control, check the bags, then get back into the passport line. This was frustrating, but since we had left a ridiculous amount of time to make the flight we didn't actually have a problem. In addition, the employees marshaling the passport lines were very heads-up and were moving people to fill gaps in the line. They also appeared responsive to pleas about flights departing soon, including those in English. We were of course pretty worried about whether our bags would vaporize on the way to JFK but fortunately everything showed up and was undamaged. All of this means we were very fortunate, since we were flying midsummer when all of the horror stories were happening and  we didn't have to deal with AF ground service, which in our experience has never been terrible but never better than OK, either.  The in flight experience was fine, although AF is one airline where it pays to fly Premium Economy. We flew regular Economy because of the size of our group, and the service was less. Cabin staff very pleasant as usual but not very visible apart from meal service. Much more attentive the further forward you go, which is not a very passenger-centric strategy. The aircraft wasn't new but had been refreshed. IFE worked and had lots of options. Outbound flight took off late but landed almost on time, return flight was on time. In Premium Economy or Business Class Air France an excellent airline, but in Economy it's a little disappointing. AF could learn a lot from Delta, which provides pretty good service throughout the cabin, or even from United, which is mediocre front to back. Most of my international travel is to France, and most of that is on Air France. This is unlikely to change. Still, I live in hope that Air France ups its game on the service front.",The in flight experience was fine
Air France,"Shame on Air France for its disgraceful performance and for doing nothing thus far to settle a claim for clothes and incidentals I had to buy after my luggage was delayed last December  when returning from Guinea to Washington DC in business class. I must have now called Air France a dozen times to find out the status of my claim. Each time, I get bounced around from one agent to another, each of whom appears completely unable to provide any help whatsoever. One agent today told me that the only way to communicate with AF is via social media and suggested I try Twitter and Facebook. I've already tried both of those months ago and never have had any response. I've now escalated the matter with my firm and with AMEX which did the booking as my company's corporate travel partner. Shame on Air France. I've never encountered such incompetence.",never encountered such incompetence
Air France,"We just had a return flight scheduled via Air France on August 1st. We arrived 2.5 hours early to Charles de Gaulle but the bag drop-off took 1 hour then we were stopped for having carry-on bags too large at security and had to return to check the carry-ons, after this, we had 50 minutes until departure but security machine broke and caused abnormal security delays of an hour. We missed the flight. It then took 2 hours of waiting at Air France ticketing to learn the next flight would be 6 days away (with us having NO luggage). We opt for another flight on a different airline and airport but now to get our bags ... another 5 hours of waiting to get our 2 carry-on bags. We are told to return in the morning to pick up our other 2 large checked bags that had been pulled from the plane. We come back to CDG, wait 1.5 hours in a 5 person line to find out that those bags cannot be accessed, and they have to send them across the ocean and deliver to our home address. Unbelievable service from Air France. No apologies from anyone or care for the extraordinary mess of lines! One bag has been found but the other is untraceable.",5 hours waiting to get our 2 carry-on bags
Air France,"Check in in YUL was quick but not smiley. Lounge welcome none, food not eatable, Champagne from a cheap brand. These are the only bad news from 2 flights that went smoothly, with excellent on-board service. 16 years old 777, retrofitted, but showing signals of usage. Small (14 seats) business class cabin, therefore very quiet. Connecting in CDG was made easy, with separate immigration for connecting passengers. Lounge in CDG was packed at 6:00 AM ! As usual MRS baggage delivery at MRS is a shame, with no respect for priority bags. Not AF fault; just bad service form third party services.",excellent on-board service
Air France,"Vancouver to Paris. My wife and I paid for direct roundtrip flights from Vancouver (YVR) to Paris (CDG) for our honeymoon trip, and that's where our first experience (and probably last) with Air France goes horrible. To start, our direct return flight home to Vancouver got cancelled, and they tried to put us on a connecting flight a day earlier, which obviously does not work with our travel plans as we are not even in Paris that 1 day earlier. Secondly, our seat selections for both our outbound and return flights that we made suddenly disappeared and my wife and I got separated to seats that were not together. We had booked our flights way earlier and there were lots of seat options at the time, but because they for whatever reason lost our seats, there were no good options left and my wife and I were stuck with choosing the only remaining option left for 2 seats together that were terrible, because all the seat selections had been taken now. I had to go through multiple several hour long phone calls with customer service to 1) get on a new connecting flight (no longer direct) for our return flight home, and 2) sort our all the seat selections for all of these flights, now that we were no longer on direct flights. What's weird is that our connecting flight home is now on Delta Airlines for both legs, not Air France? And they could not confirm me and my wife's seat selections to be next to each other for these flights, probably because they are on Delta Airlines rather than Air France? To make complaints, the customer service phone line does not handle this as they only handle reservations. We filled out the online complaint form on June 22 and have yet to hear back, as our flight is in less than a month now. We called their customer service line multiple times again to follow up on our complaint case #, but was told each time that they cannot do anything to help. When we asked to speak to a supervisor/manager, or be transferred to ANYONE who could possibly help, they said there is no human we can speak to directly, nobody they could transfer me to, no email or phone number to directly contact, and that I would have to wait for an email response to our complaint form, which again we had already waited for more than 1.5 months. In summary, this is our first time booking with Air France, and we have never experience such terrible non-existent customer service. This is not a single human you can speak to directly who can help with making things right. All you can do is submit an online complaint form into a black hole of cases that will never be addressed. I've tried multiple channels to reach ANYONE who can help, but each time I was told there is nobody who can help you, sir. Avoid Air France's archaic customer service system at all costs.",there is nobody who can help you
Air France,"During the aircraft loading process, my suitcase was first placed next to the loading belt, then at some point scanned and placed on the back of the trolley that pulls the suitcase dolly (I could watch the whole process from the window the whole time). That seemed strange to me, so I asked the stewardess in English if that was the right thing to do and she only said that the hold was full and the suitcase was loaded in the back. That struck me as odd, too, but that could be the case, I thought to myself and sat down again. More suitcases arrived, still being loaded into the same hold (so apparently the hold wasn't full after all). Meanwhile, my suitcase was still lying on the back of the car. At some point no more suitcases came and the loading belt was retracted. So I went to the stewardess again and told her that my suitcase is still on the back of this car and that the luggage strap is now being removed. After a short discussion, she fetched the pilot, who left the plane with my suitcase badge. I looked out the window and unfortunately the car on which my suitcase was lying was gone now too. After a minute or two the pilot came back and just said don't worry my suitcase will be on board. Then I just said if he was sure, because the last time I checked, my suitcase was still on the car and the luggage strap was retracted. The stewardess then answered me something in French, I just said that unfortunately I don't speak French and that's why I had spoken to her in English beforehand, she answered in French again. I sat down again and during the pushback I saw all the trolleys lined up and of course my suitcase was still on one of these trolleys.  My suitcase arrived in Düsseldorf the next evening, one of the four wheels had broken off, a wheel bearing had broken out, one of the two locks had broken and the suitcase was so warped that it could no longer be closed. A Rimowa aluminum case that has endured a lot for 8 years. The destruction of the suitcase, of course has more to do with Paris Airport, but the whole thing would probably not have happened like this if my suitcase had been loaded, because as the next to the baggage carousel at the airfield, all 4 wheels were still attached.

Air France,"I make several international trips a year. This trips' flights with Air France were clearly the worst. We were only on this AF flight with our Delta reservations because of code sharing. Not only were the flight attendants condescending, food inedible and the ground service bizarre,  to add insult to injury, they lost our luggage and cannot locate it. AF's service desk is impossible to get on the phone. I have been trying for a day and a half since we returned to ask about the status of my missing luggage. We called Delta and after a wait of over an hour were told we should have called AF. Finally after a wait of over 2 hours we got a person to speak at AF -- the person manning the phones said they live in a status of perpetual wonderment as to where the luggage was and had certainly no idea where mine was. Frustration, upset, anger, disappointment. I will never fly Air France again. If you have an option, take another airline unless you can pack all your clothes in a carry on.",lost our luggage and cannot locate it
Air France,"We have traveled Internationally many times but we have never experienced anything like this. The customer service was absolutely rude, inpatient, and untruthful. All of our connection flights were an hour late. Most importantly, our flight had a 10 hour layover in Paris coming from Greece. I reached out to customer service using the 800 237 2747 which is not even located in France (it is a call center in India) who have informed me several times, all I needed to do was submit an online claim for hotel accommodation on our 10 hour overnight layover. When I submit the online claim they tell me to call back the 800 number who then informed me I need to reach out through Facebook messenger. On that communication I was informed I should ask for accommodation in person when I get to Paris. Upon our arrival in Paris at 11.40pm the customer service informed us they will not be providing us with hotel accommodation since we bought the ticket knowing there was a layover. They only provide accommodation if your flight is canceled or delayed. This did not make sense because all of their flights from Greece to Washington, D.C. had layovers at the time of our booking. This was completely new information for us since we have been communicating with their customer service for over three weeks before our travel which could have made our own hotel booking if they didn't lead us to believe they will provide one for us. Because we arrived around midnight there was no hotel available for us during our layover and we had to sleep at the airport. We are absolutely disappointed with how they handled the conversation at their customer service office in Paris where we were told, “sorry you received misinformation but since our call center is not in France we cannot control what information they give.” This is the first airline we know of that have no control over their customer service. We will never use this airline and I advise anyone who might have similar flying scenario to make your own accommodation regardless of what the customer service tells you. We were not the only people who spent the night at the airport, there were many families with kids who slept on the floor. Absolutely horrible the way they speak to you and also condescending.",We were not the only people who spent the night at the airport

However boarding at Marseille was one of the most messy I have ever seen, due to the lack of instructions of staff. Direct channel from Terminal 2F to Terminal 2E (K), with dedicated immigration and no security check was of great relief. Splendid. Catering at lounge was excellent. Boarding of flight to YUL was also a torture, as we had to wait under the sun (during the heat wave) on a ramp during more than 20 minutes.

IFE not working for the return leg of my journey (ICN-CDG). Complained 9 weeks ago, checked my claim progress on 20/07/2022 and still just showing as received. Checked again today and now they can't find it. They don't reply to calls, emails, their WhatsApp communication is with an infuriating bot which serves 0 purpose. When you ask to be passed to a service agent you'll get no reply until 2-3 days later where they explain their agents are busy.",Complained 9 weeks ago
Air France,"Online check-in and bag drop at Heathrow were straightforward, but the boarding procedure was cumbersome due to an apparent shortage of people at the gate (only 1 for most of the time). A gate between the queue to enter the departure lounge and the lounge itself was left open and one passenger managed to wander through, by-passing the gate agent. Luckily they noticed it and firmly directed the passenger back to the queue. This could have been an administrative if not security problem. On board the service was efficient and pleasant. We were delighted to find that AF served a decent snack on short-haul flights (a sandwich plus a choice of alcoholic or soft drinks). Probably because of the slow boarding process at Heathrow our first leg to CDG operated 25 minutes late, resulting in us having to sprint up and down staircases at CDG to catch our onward flight to Lisbon. Our baggage made it too -- phew! All in all this was a pleasant experience, especially onboard.",this was a pleasant experience
Air France,One of the worst baggage service I ever seen. I travelled on end of June and still not received my missing baggage. 10 days back Got a mail saying your baggage was found and it’s on your way but after I haven’t received any information from the airline. Very disappointed with the service. Now I have to travel back to my place without my bag.,worst baggage service I ever seen
Air France,"They have no process in place to smoothly inform people how to declare missing baggage and how to schedule a delivery. I've called the help line over 12 times and have been on hold for upwards of 45 minutes before the line hanging up on me. None of the support options seem to work and I've done my best to be patient, but I would really like an update. On the flight, we were given our meals and for an hour and a half, they let our trays sit there. They didn't pick up the trays for so long that people were helping each other out by holding their trash so they could move about the cabin. The flight attendants were nice, even if not very prompt. They seemed as upset about the situation as we were. I'm still on hold (day 2 trying to speak to someone) as I write this review.",The flight attendants were nice
Air France,"The tickets for our flight were bought online, yet at check-in, we were told the flight was full and that we had to board a different flight with a stop over at Amsterdam. We were originally going from Lyon to Venice. The new route costed us a delay of more than 2 hours. Each flight we boarded, or checked-in for, we were told they did not have a seat for us until everyone else had boarded. It felt like we had bought last-minute budget tickets and treated less than everybody else. Yet we had spent a large amount to travel to Venice. The entire journey we were still grateful we could fly and hopeful we could get to our destination. It was stressful to say the least. This has been a bad experience and I don't recommend Air France.",This has been a bad experience
Air France,"I flew from Lisbon to Osaka via Paris. The flight was delayed for two hours and when we arrive, we had to wait for another hour to find that there was no luggage. It is now the 14/07/2022 and I still don't have my luggage! Last Saturday, I received a message saying the luggage was found. But I have not received the luggage yet. Therefore, and considering the very long time I have been without luggage and without actually managing to talk, exchange messages or even smoke signs with Air France, I found the company unreliable with a terrible customer service.",I still don't have my luggage
Air France,It has been 4 days and no information or sign of luggage! I cannot reach any customer service number (France or Mexico) for days and have been waiting on Facebook chat for a day now. The tracer says that the luggage was supposed to be delivered yesterday and there is no status update. I tried to add a claim and the website gives me error when I submit. I ordered special meal when flying and it wasn't there and I had to have their standard meal.,no information or sign of luggage
Air France,"What a shambles and I will never fly with Air France again. This flight was 1.5 hours late, which seems normal for that flight.  AF had tried to throw me off my connecting flight and put me on one for the next day but the check-in girl at BKK managed to reverse it and I made the flight. I asked on exit how far away my next gate was but they didn’t have a clue. A 2-3-2 business class is decades out of date and the cabin crew were men who did their job in a minimalist manner but there was no friendliness or engagement with the passengers, downright miserable. The food felt very overly reheated. There looks like a lot of pages of movies but a lot of it was many copies of the same film, no idea what that was about as you choose your language when you click on play. They get round their terrible performance by using that awful and insulting catch-all phrase, “For operational reasons”. When we landed at CDG there was another plane still at our gate.",will never fly with Air France again
Air France,My trip is over and I have still not received my bag. Horrible service. They do not answer phone calls or respond to emails. They literally left me high and dry. The fact that my holiday is over and still no correspondence from this retched airline I feel is reason enough not to fly with them. Honestly ruined what was supposed to be a relaxing time.,still not received my bag.
Air France,"Our flight from Nairobi was delayed 3 hours. When we got to Paris we missed our flight to Toronto they told us we have to wait 9 hours, which changed to 14 hours. They lost my stroller.

Air France,"The check in lines were long and there were not enough staff. The flight delayed for over an hour, more than 5 baggage were lost in a flight which causing a long queue on the luggage center. However, there were only two staff there. The staff promised to deliver the missing baggage to my address within a week. Turn out it is still missing while I am writing this comment, which is almost a month since my flight. I tried different methods to contact Air France and it is really hard to call them. There is a email that you will never get a response. There exists a phone number but you had to wait for at least 35 minutes before they pick up your call. I Called a lot in these three weeks ,wasting a lot of times but no one really could help. I went to the airport, imagining someone can help if I meet them, but the baggage service center was closed and all other staffs told me they can do nothing. So basically if you take Air France and the baggage is lost during the flight, you will not be able to do anything and no one from Air France can help you.",promised to deliver the missing baggage
Air France,"I flew with Air France on flight AF1424 on 3rd July 2022 from Paris to Berlin. I knew there were cases of large queues for luggage check-ins and anticipating this, I left for the airport 4 hrs earlier and arrived 3.5hrs earlier than my flight time. And as expected, the line was huge. Despite the fact that they had automatic machines where you could check in your luggage, those machines opened late and 3-5 members of Air France were operating those counters. When the machines started running, people did not know how to use them. For example, if your bag were overweight by a certain threshold, the machine would get stuck. Thus, requiring human interference (or maybe people just didn’t know) to make it start working again. Secondly, the machine did not mention that you need to check in your hand luggage also. So, people had to come back from security. There was also a long line of people printing luggage tags after getting in line. Thus coming back and forth into the queues and stalling the people behind them. There were people just getting in line without waiting for their turn.  Some of the cabin crew were gloomy.",Some of the cabin crew were gloomy
Air France,"The connecting flight from Paris to New Delhi was cancelled. We were made to board the flight, sat inside from 10.30am to 3pm after which announcement was made that flight is postponed to the next day. No one was assisting to answer queries. All we were told was to go to gate K57 and arrangements would be made. Only arrangement was made for business class passengers as if rest were travelling for free. Air France lounges denied entry even after many were ready to pay charges from pocket. It is 12.03 at night and no one from Air France has come.",flight is postponed to the next day
Air France,"The tickets are very expensive (I paid 350 GBP for a flight one way), there is no option to buy a fast track, the flight was made by a subsidiary airline where there was no space for my luggage, the leg space is limited. Standard of this airline is below poor.",tickets are very expensive
Air France,"Thank you Air France for providing exceptional customer service. I read these reviews and they mostly appear to be only a bad experience. But my experience had the potential to be bad, but you handled it exceedingly well. My flight from Firenze to CDG was going to arrive late and I would miss my connection. In flight, the attendant told me I was going to miss the connection, my new flight was already booked for the next day, and that I would be provided a hotel and meals. When I arrived every word of this was true. I stayed in a very nice airport hotel (Golden Lotus) that provided exceptional buffet style food, I used the hotel shuttle, and you also gave me a meal voucher as well for the airport. I was concerned leaving my luggage overnight in the airport, but it arrived safely in LAX the following day. You could not have made this any easier, and I was really only delayed about 12 hours in total. I've flown with you 3 times now to Italy and you will always be my first choice. Yes, occasionally I may experience an inconvenience, but I will always remember how you handled this perfectly. My only suggestion for the foreign traveler would be maybe to have a printed map (handed to them by the flight attendant) with the details where the Air France Customer Service kiosk is located, and also where the hotel shuttles are located. It's such a huge airport and this took me a little time to navigate.",providing exceptional customer service
Air France,"I take a yearly trip to Tunisia, and I've flown with a lot of airlines over the years. I have encountered delays and issues with flight logistics but it was always handled smoothly and professionally by the airline. This time I tried Air France because they offered a trip without much waiting time before the corresponding flight, and what a huge mistake I made. First trip from Montreal to Paris was cancelled out of nowhere. No explanation was given and the only heads up I got was an email that was filtered as a spam since they sent it through a shady email. They rescheduled that flight for another one that got delayed for 2 hours. No heads up this time and of course no explanation. The cancellation and the delay made me miss my corresponding flight and instead of getting the first flight available to Tunis they booked me on a flight 13 hr after I land in Paris. I tried to find a solution with the airline's customer service in Paris Orly but according to them there was no flight before the one I had in 13hrs (even though there was and they scheduled it for some of the people in the line). The AF customer service in Paris Orly were really difficult to deal with, they will ignore you if they don't like the question (asked for directions on how to get to the airport hotel and how I can do an online claim on the issue), some of them will yell in frustration if you ask the same question twice (I was really tired and I couldn't really hear them well over the counter). Needless to say that this is my first and last trip with AF. I really recommend anybody flying long distance to avoid AF at all costs, they do not seem to be able to handle the logistics of a corresponding trip.",this is my first and last trip with AF
Air France,"My husband and I experienced the worst bag checking experience of our lives on Sunday June 23rd with Air France in Paris traveling to Nice!  First, we were overcharged for our bags going from Paris to Nice. When we arrived the kiosks charged us $70, but it was only supposed to be $45. I tried to ask multiple Air France representatives for help and everyone ignored us and kept walking by. Since no one would help, we paid the $70 to get out of there. But one of our bag tags was missing. We paid for 3 $70 tags but we only received 2 printed. So we had to go get in line for a representative to help us. The line was long and moving slow. Once we got to the front, the Ai France representative confirmed that we were not supposed to be charged $70/bag we were only supposed to pay $45/bag. But he said he couldn’t issue a refund and we would have to file a claim which we are doing now. But he was trying to make us pay $45 again for the missing bag tag. He printed the tag for us and we put it on our bag, but after he realized I wasn’t going to pay the $45, since I already paid $70 for it, he ripped the tag off my bag.  I requested a manager and the manager told him he was wrong, and reprinted us a tag and told us to get in line to drop off our bags. This drop off line was so long and there was only 1 person at the front desk with 10+ stations. Finally when we got to the front, the third bag tag wouldn’t scan, so again we needed assistance which took pulling teeth to get. We waited and no one would help. Finally a manager saw us and took us to the side station, reprinted yet another tag and checked the bag for us and sent us to security to go to our gate. This entire situation took almost 2 hours which made us nearly miss our flight. When we landed in Monaco, 1 of our 3 bags did not show up.  We had to file a claim at the airport which the line was long and it took over an hour. We were in Monaco for 3 nights and the bag never came. It still says “searching” on the claim; they haven’t found it. This experience has caused us so much unnecessary stress and anxiety.",caused us so much unnecessary stress
Air France,"My flight was 6+ hours delayed from JFK, got rebooted on 3 different flights from Paris to Bordeaux, actually made the last flight of the day. Of course the airline lost the luggage and now in Bordeaux they sent an email that one cannot respond to for sending the luggage to our hotel but they gave the wrong number to call back and cannot get in touch to coordinate the lost bag reaching our hotel. 2 days after landing in Bordeaux still no bag. Stay away from this airline, I will never book with them again.",airline lost the luggage
Air France,"I was dissatisfied with the business class flight from Paris to Mumbai round trip. The flat bed was more like a recliner seat and my food was not up to the quality. Flight back from Paris to LAX took off late and I was very hungry. Flight attendant gave me menu, I chose salmon, she mentioned that is not available since it has been taken. No issues but when I paid a premium to travel business, should not I expect better. Given vegetarian which was very salty.",food was not up to the quality
Air France,"Due to delayed arrival from another flight, our group of six travelers missed our connection in Paris.

Air France,"Osaka to Rome via Paris. I chose to travel with Air France  because it was the cheapest and the shortest route. I would recommend flying with them as the trip was ok, but there are things to improve! Duration of the first flight is 15 hours. Although I was worried for this very long trip, time passed quickly aboard. I didn't watch any movies, but I peeked at the selection and it was very large and there were films that came out recently or great classics. Super positive note the wifi is free for everyone just to send light messages (no audio, no photos) but if you pay you can get it faster! The seats were very uncomfortable for me, my seat was dirty, crumbs on the seat and food stains on the table. In times of covid this is very serious for me. The Air France site is difficult to handle. I wanted to change my flight, I did all the steps and then it gave me ERROR, and when I returned to the original booking page they canceled the seats I had purchased in advance ... luckily I contacted the company via messenger and they put everything back to normal! In the end I discovered that to change the flight you have to call a number. But be prepared, if you call the number from Japan you will have to wait 30/40 minutes !! A particular appreciation for a female flight attendant on the flight from Osaka, and a male flight attendant on the flight to Rome. Both very kind and helpful.",would recommend flying with them
Air France,Just flew from Copenhagen to Paris to Montreal on June 17th. We were behind schedule when we landed at CDG with only a small chance of making our connecting flight that day. My wife made it to the correct gate and was able to board while I ended up at the wrong gate. I would like to offer a huge thank you to Captain Emmanuel Rollier who insisted the plane would not leave until I arrived at the plane. The rest of the crew were equally supportive and helped create a positive ending to what had been a very stressful day. Thanks again to Captain and crew.,rest of the crew were equally supportive
Air France,"I would like to mention the name of Mr Sunil Lohat who did a great job by helping us and making our journey very comfortable. I think without the help of this gentleman, it wouldn't have been possible for us to board the flight. Mr Sunil helped us till the last moment and ensured that we board the flight. He did everything which a customer needs during any technical hitches which is not known to the passenger. Hats off to such a committed and helping person.  He really made our day in the time of crisis and now I have landed Toronto without any hassles.",He really made our day

I think currently AF is the best airline in Europe.",A smooth and hassle-free flight
Air France,"Delayed on initial flight for both our departure and return trips. This caused us to miss our connection. Each time Air France made it incredibly difficult to rebook. We had to wander CDG airport where no one was there to assist, when we found the Air France desk they were understaffed and waited hours in line to get a new flight. This is all with our 5 month old son. Horrible attitudes and no sense of urgency in trying to get us home. They also lost one of my bags on the initial trip which was returned. However, all 5 of our bags were missing when we got home. It has been 5 days and countless phone calls and nothing has been done to tell us where our bags are or when to expect them. Items include stroller, car seat, and breast pump so my wife can provide milk to feed our son. All of these items had to be replaced because we cannot wait in limbo for them. Their call service automatically drops your call if it is longer than a 45min wait time so if you do not call at the exact minute of their opening you are more than likely not going to be able to speak to a customer service agent. I will never take any airline that connects in CDG and will absolutely avoid Air France at all costs. The flight attendants were great and the only positive interactions we had were with them.",will avoid Air France at all costs
Air France,"I flew Air France return for my trip to the UK. Seats were small, service apathetic, CDG was a huge disappointment.

Air France,"Air France / KLM lure you with the free change ticket. Unluckily, it's an hoax. To begin with, no matter what's the actual price difference, I was asked to pay an amount of money that equal/ed the price of the full ticket at minimum. Eventually, I decided to accept it and was going to pay to change the ticket for my return flight. while I was shown several options, only a tiny percentage were available to book, maybe 30%. All the rest gave a system error and a message to call their hotline, which cost me a lot of wasted time. When I called the hotline, they told the flight was available, but cost more than the full price of a one way ticket.

Air France,"First leg GVA-CDG was delayed due to circumstances outside of AF's control, I completely understand. But I still managed to get to the gate to my CDG-EZE flight with just 5-10 minutes delay. we arrived to find the plane still at the gate but boarding closed. So AF's team had to deny boarding to the 20+ passengers that arrived just a few minutes late. We were then sent to the AF counter AND were assigned a hotel some 40 minutes drive from the airport (this was almost midnight by then). We were told a shuttle would take us to the hotel. We come out to an empty parking lot, no shuttle in sight. In the end we had to google the hotel's name and pay for a uber to take us there. We arrive to the hotel (which was partially under construction) at around 1AM, and the hotel manager has no idea if and when AF will send a shuttle to bring me back to the airport. AF set me in an Iberia flight via Madrid, so I had to be back at the airport at 5.30AM.  I make it back to the airport, to find out my luggage was not transferred by AF to Iberia, so I would have to leave without it.

Air France,"Business class cabin is not the newest one in airline industry but still very good. The window seat is spacious with very much room for ones feet (perfect in flat bed mode) and very comfy. I slept very well.

IFE: Screen size and selection are good, picture quality is not on par with modern systems - but of course you can not expect this. The crew has been very friendly and helpful, food was plenty and delicious with a great starter (picture) and one of the best steaks I ever had on board (sorry, forgot to take a picture). Check in in SFO was very slow (almost 40 minutes for 12 people) but otherwise no complaints. Lounge was small and crowded, but food, beverages and WIFI were very good.

Air France,"Abuja to Amsterdam via Paris. Very disrespectful to their customers. Initially, the return flight was booked for a Saturday evening. But 2 months in advance Air France cancelled the flight. Since there was only one flight a day, we had to reschedule for the Sunday flight. Air France did not want to book a hotel or pay (part of the extra hotel costs). On check-in at Abuja, check-in was denied, because the flight was scheduled for the day before (Saturday), doh. Even though I was carrying the ticket with the new date, the booking confirmation and the e-mail about the cancellation, they refused boarding. At long last, the ticket office printed a new ticket for Sunday, and informed us, that they would not charge us at this time. On arrival in Paris, there was a technical problem with the bridge, which delayed the flight by half an hour. Air France staff refused to assist to help us catch the connecting flight. As a result, we missed the flight. At the transfer counter, the helpful staff informed us of this fact, as if we were to blame for it. On arrival in Amsterdam, of course, our bags were missing. We claimed the missing bags immediately. It took Air France a full week, to deliver the bags (from Paris to Amsterdam). When they eventually delivered the bags, one was damaged (broken handle). We also claimed the damage on the handle immediately. So far it has been 3 weeks, and Air France is not responding to any requests, nor handling our damage claim. I would row a boat to Nigeria than fly with an airline that is so disinterested in their customers. Never again.",Very disrespectful
Air France,"Delayed take-off by two hours from YYZ. Having waited for a while in Mumbai for my suitcase, I finally made it to the counter to file a claim.  It took me 4 hours to get out of the airport trying to file a claim for the missing baggage. The Air France representative  Mr. Akash was nothing but polite, courteous, and a star that worked under pressure. Whilst the process was disorganized and lacked manpower, he was single-handedly managing AF travelers.  I hope they track and manage to deliver my luggage on time.","nothing but polite, courteous"
Air France,"Paris to Amsterdam with Air France, KLM from Amsterdam to Tokyo and AirCalin from Tokyo to Noumea. I had so many issues, I am not sure where to start! First, my return flight from Paris to Noumea was changed so many times, I lost track, but it was at least 5 times. At least two times, they cancelled one leg only, but did not provide further information as to alternative flights. Other times, they provided an inconvenient alternative, and then it was almost impossible to reach a real person to select a viable alternative (3-4 days chatting through facebook - like a bad combination of email and chatting). After our last change, we got a new e-ticket and itinerary, only they never updated the real times. And we never got a message telling us that the flight had changed. As you usually do, we trusted the itinerary that they had sent, but we got to the airport just in time to get in. Lucky we had decided to get to the airport 4 hours before the flight, rather than 3. After running all over the airport, and no support whatsoever to get through the security checks, we made it just in time to board the plane - only to be seated and wait for an extra hour before the plane actually took off - because they decided to check the covid requirements during boarding! They found one person without the requirements, and then we all had to wait for the poor luggage staff to find this person's baggage inside the plane and remove it!",return flight was changed so many times

Air France,"My issue with Air France is that I bought a No fee change ticket and since trying to change my return ticket which is on the 8th May 2022 I have got nothing but the run around. As for a customer service it is non existent. I am in Peru and cannot get my flight from Costa Rica on that date and I did manage to chat with some form of humanoid/robot on their chat line via facebook, for 6 days messaging back and forth with no actual assistance whatsoever. Every time I suggested a flight or date I could exchange my ticket for they told me I could not do it. There is no customer service, no one to speak to or even email, and once they have your money you are hung out to dry. Hence they have taken £612 for a flight that is worth £300 due to the fact that they will not not honour their no fee change policy. I am not asking for a refund but to exchange my ticket for another flight. I have already stated that I am prepared to pay extra if it is a flight that is more expensive.",got nothing but the run around
Air France,"Tel Aviv to Toronto via Paris. The first leg of our trip was really substandard. The plane itself was fine, but the cabin crew provided almost no service and were unpleasant, verging on aggressive. The food also was very low quality. The second leg of our trip was much better, with a pleasant cabin crew and much better food. The customer service has been terrible. We called to follow up on a number of issues and again encountered unpleasant staff who seemed to have very little desire to help and who were sometimes even rude.

Air France,"1 hour flight from Paris to Newcastle, what can go wrong? I take no pleasure in writing this review, if you look at my previous reports most from memory are positive, a few bad experiences. This is the worst flight in my life, simple. Congratulations to Air France to achieve going from being my preferred airline to the last I would use in one step. The flight was not great, but not terrible, my seat had very little legroom but I’d just come if a Qatar Airways business class flight so maybe that clouded my judgement a little. Anyway they didn’t bother to put my bag on the aircraft. It wasn’t lost, they knew exactly where it was, in their home airport they could find someone to put it in the plane. Did they put it in the next flight, no. Did they put it in the next day?  Air France chose  not to send my bag today. They sent me an email saying they had the bag just after midnight so they had 10 hours to put it in AF1058 this morning. They didn’t do it. They chose to not send it. This is an airline that does not respect its passengers, I have no issue with airlines losing bags, it’s annoying but it happens.",didn’t bother to put my bag on the aircraft

Needless to state I lost all the money spent on a Tuxedo, shirt and shoes for being the bestman in the wedding as a result of the impromptu cancellation by Air France hours after waiting for boarding. When I got back to the U.S, I filed a claim on Thursday the 27th of Janurary, 2022 for compensation for my losses as a result of the cancellation. It took Air France more than three months to respond and say that because the flight was cancelled as a result of technical issues they would not be compensating me for my losses. NO phone calls!

Air France,"Madrid to Cork via Paris. I took the ticket with KLM and a few days after travelling, one of the stops I had planned was cancelled. They change my ticket with a stopover in Paris and the first thing: I'm still waiting for the difference between the ticket that I paid more for. They don't add the previous travel insurance to the new ticket. Air France sends an email that the flight is delayed a few days before and then at 1 am when the flight leaves at 6:10 am they send an SMS that is delayed another 40 minutes. Once on the plane, it was delayed another 40 minutes. No one explains why. Inside the plane, already arriving in Paris, it is going to land and a few seconds before this, it takes off again. Why? Nobody tells us anything. It gives me an anxiety attack not knowing what's going on, all the delays we had with this airline and the. Concern that I won't get to catch the other link and I get up to ask. I am dragged by the steward by the arm through the plane to my seat. Disrespecting me and making me and those around me even more nervous because we really believed that something very, very serious was happening since the stewardess' reaction was very abrupt. After arriving in Paris I had to run to catch the next flight to Cork. I arrive in Cork and they have lost my suitcase. I file the claim, they tell me that today I will have my suitcase, that they have sent it to cork because it must have stayed in Paris and still no one has called me, nor have I received my suitcase or anything. A disaster. I will not take this airline again and I will make complaints and claims until I get bored. Because the lack of control they have, the lack of respect, etc... is not even normal.",lack of respect
Air France,Three times they made the same mistake and didn’t confirm our seats on our Delta flights before our international ones. Had to spend part of my time on my vacation on hold and dealing with them to make sure it doesn’t happen on the way back and it still did. And they just said there was nothing they could do.  The stress is not worth booking through this airline.,didn’t confirm our seats on our Delta flights
Air France,"Bucharest to Paris. Air France, economy class, AF 1889 March 12th 2022. The Flight Attendants are overall welcoming and helpful. The Airbus A320 has a clean cabin. The seat feels narrow, although it's mentioned that this is a 32' X 18' seat - better than the unacceptable 30' X 17' that many airlines (including Air France) dare offer, even on long-haul flights. Departure on time. Coffee or tea and one very thin sandwich. Arrival on time. Overall a good experience, mostly thanks to the welcoming crew onboard. However, as an Aeroflot (SkyTeam Partner) Bonus Member, I'm still waiting for the miles to be credited on my Aeroflot Frequent flyer account, I did mention the number on reservation and the number is mentioned on my boarding pass.",a good experience
Air France,"Extremely poor customer service. They want everyone to check in at the kiosk. Done. The kiosk asks me to see a customer service rep. I go to stand in line, the rep guiding everyone asks me to go to the baggage drop off line inspite of me showing him the message. I stand in the baggage drop off line for half hour. They cannot print my boarding pass. Then the rep from the baggage drop line tells me to go to the customer service line. So I go to the line, and lo behold the rep is standing there. After hearing my story and smirking he guides me to the customer service line. So now I stand in line again! For another 30 minutes.",Extremely poor customer service
Air France,"My flight from CGD to ORD was delayed by 4+ hours due to a computer glitch on the aircraft. The flight crew then scrambled around to find another AF around the airport. All the luggage, catering etc. had to be transferred, and then we went back to the gate and boarded the replacement aircraft. AF emailed me explaining my EU rights to file a claim.  After four months of processing, they denied the claim saying, I arrived to CDG from a non-EU airport. AF took over four months to process this claim. The reason thy gave was, they were busy. I got no compensation, and we were not offered any refreshments on the day.  I'm not flying AF again.",I got no compensation
Air France,"I traveled to Boston from Tunis on March 5th, when I arrived to Boston they told me that my baggage is delayed and it should arrive in two days, its been 6 days now and no answer. I call daily and check online status of my claim everyday. They have the worst customer service ever. The last customer service person said that my suitcase is on the way and it should arrive on March 10 at 1pm, I called at 5 pm he said its in Logan airport and it will be delivered to me tomorrow. I called again in the morning I spent 1.5 hrs at the end they told me that my luggage is still in Paris.",6 days now and no answer
Air France,"The A350 plane is great for passengers (comfortable and quiet). However, the service in Mumbai is sub-par at best and the service on board was not good. I was unable to check-in via their website - they weighed my bags at the check-in counter in Mumbai and they weighed by back pack and my carry on. I had 8kg more than their limit and they asked to me to either pay $200 to check it in or remove excess weight. I removed the excess weight but was still 3kgs over. I asked if I could pay for the extra (3KG) and she said we don't negotiate. The Ground Staff Manager was unwilling to even engage in conversation.  On board they served the first meal within 30 minutes but did not serve any alcohol. The Stewardess said they don't serve it because it's too early and not served with breakfast.  7 hrs and 30 minutes later they served lunch, nothing served in between. I asked for a beer and the stewardess said no.",service in Mumbai is sub-par at best
Air France,"Nice flight, food was OK. My seat 43H had loads of leg room. Flight was half full. Free Wi-Fi for message sending nice touch touch. Entertainment was OK .Nice staff & service.

Air France,"Wonderful flights, flying like in the good old days. Good food, open bar, friendly FAs, good IFE with lots of good films/music, even on short European flights you get a snack and an open bar. They even let me check my bag for free both ways. Fantastic.",flying like in the good old days

No excuse for this on a smooth flight with no turbulence.",Air France customer review
Air France,"First medium-haul experience with Air France. This is part of a connecting flight from LHR-MIA via CDG. Check-in at LHR was swift, thanks to Sky Priority (customers flying Premium Economy get Sky Priority access). Due to COVID, check-in meant extra checks and formalities during check-in. All my documents were verified in less than 20 minutes. I received my onward boarding pass to MIA. This is my first medium-haul trip with Air France. The equipment used on this flight was a 10 year old Boeing 777-300ER. I was among the first passengers to board this full and busy flight. The cabin crew upon boarding were very friendly and warm. The plane was in an immaculate condition and was kept very clean. We left 45 minutes behind schedule due to technicalities and the crew gave regular updates. After take off, the crew sprung into action. They distributed a sanitary kit which consisted of a mask, alcohol surface wipes and hand sanitiser. We were told that unfortunately, amenity kits were not loaded on this flight and the crew were very apologetic. The meal service was swift but was done with care. Lunch served was good in quality but lacking in quantity which is the only downside. The crew were also very proactive with the drinks service. After the main meal service, cabin lights were switched off and were invited to help ourselves to the self-help snack bar which was adequately stocked with drinks and snacks. The second meal service came in a rather chic paper bag which consisted of a warm sandwich, a bread roll, a muffin, a chocolate bar, orange juice and a yoghurt drink. In addition, drinks were served again. For a 9 hour flight, the quality of the meals served was good but lacking in quantity. Air France could perhaps increase their portions when it comes to Premium Economy dining. The seat on this aircraft is Air France's fixed shell seat which mean that rather than reclining, the seat slides forwards so that it does not intrude your personal space. The seat was wide with good cushion padding. The pillow and blanket also appeared to be off higher quality compared to other airlines I've flown with in Premium Economy. The seat also came with a leg rest which was a very good addition. Now, there are a lot of negative reviews of this product but I would say that this seat is adequately comfortable for a TransAtlantic flight. My back did get a little sore from the seat sliding forward but I used the pillow to add some padding. I requested for an extra pillow and was given one without hesitancy. As we were flying during COVID, cabin crew and passenger interaction was very minimal to keep each other safe. However, I noted that the crew were very responsive in meeting the needs of the passengers from what I observed. IFE content was outstanding. There were more than enough new Holywood films available and a couple of French, Western, Asian and Bollywood films. In addition, the IFE offering also had plenty of radio stations and Album selections. In addition, the plan is equipped with an external camera. Air France is nowhere near a perfect carrier as there are things that Air France could do better in terms of its Premium Economy service which in my opinion would be: increasing portion sizes of meals and offering a bar service as only red wine was offered during the drinks service. Overall, Air France is a great alternative to fly across the Atlantic!",great alternative to fly across the Atlantic
Air France,"BOD-CDG-ATL: Was having some major issue with Delta Airlines on my return trip due to numerous cancellations (COVID in US) and decided to pick a return flight with Air France instead of Delta. In Bordeaux Airport, a gentleman working at Air France Sales ticket counter worked hard to accommodate me by finding me a good flight for my return trip and thank him for it knowing that Air France had to deal with many stuck Delta Airlines customers in Europe. For Bordeaux to CDG and CDG to Atlanta: Great cabin service and very nice/professional crew. Seats are bit cramped but this is economy. Strange or not but A320 domestic flight has more legroom and width than the 350-900 for the long haul. A pleasurable experience! The negative aspect is the lack of coordination between Delta, Air France and KLM regarding ticketing and seat assignments.",A pleasurable experience!
Air France,"My first flight was cancelled last minute, causing me to be rebooked on a second flight. While frustrating, this sometimes can't be helped, especially with COVID and the winter weather. However, my flights were cancelled a total of three times, costing me $450 in COVID test fees, as well as $300 in hotel costs to stay near the airport due to the last minute cancellations and rebookings. Very poor communication from staff to passengers about what was happening with flights - we were sat for over an hour after the initial departure time waiting to hear what was happening, only to be repeatedly told we would be boarding soon, followed by the surprise news that our flight was cancelled. It's incredibly frustrating to have to relay the messages back to my manager back home, and pray the next flight I book won't be cancelled. I understand that the current global situation has placed pressured on airlines, and I wouldn't be leaving a bad review over one cancelled flight. But to be told the flights will definitely be going ahead, and to be cancelled again and again, is frustrating and unprofessional for everyone involved. It also seems that very few other flights are having this happen to them, and even when I've flown during other points of the pandemic, I've never faced such poor communication and repeated cancellations. Staff were polite, but misinformation was still given, and everything felt poorly organised and poorly communicated to the staff left to answer questions to the stranded passengers. Airport travel is stressful enough, even when everything goes as planned.",poorly organised and poorly communicated
Air France,"I booked with KLM which was a nightmare. I was supposed to fly Air France SG to Rome and with KLM from Rome to SG but I changed my flight. Since my booking was made with KLM, it was impossible to get a hold of anyone when my VTL flight was cancelled and I was reassigned a non VTL flight. Air France was very professional despite my upset state and rearranged everything for me, and both my flights during this trip was extremely pleasant. The crew was very nice and helpful. I would next time just book directly with Air France. I would like to add that ground staff at CDG did a great job too. Thank you Air France!",Air France was very professional
Air France,I booked my trip 2 months in advance. This airline canceled my flight in August 2021 the day before departure with no notification (I had received my confirmations and itinerary emails reliably so if something would have been sent I would have seen it. I also checked Spam and all the Promotions and Social folders in desperation). I only found out when I tried to check in online at 5pm the day before and saw it was canceled. I tried multiple times to reach the airline for help and the line hung up automatically after playing a message about the wait time. I would have gladly waited to speak with anyone. Multiple online searches with this airline showed no other flights available to my destination so I had to book a new reservation with a different carrier at more than double the cost ($1400 vs my original $600!). I did receive a full refund of my original purchase price but the airline would not take responsibility for the fact that their poor communication forced me to spend double+ on this trip than was budgeted and it was not possible to cancel and reschedule this trip.,I did receive a full refund
Air France,"Frankfurt - Toronto via Paris CDG. My first long-haul flight in pandemic. Air France took care of safety, handed out hygiene kits and staff payed attention that everyone is wearing a mask, so I felt safe while being onboard. All flights were on time and transfer at CDG airport was easy, only passport control took some time and boarding the flight to Toronto was a big chaos when all the documents were checked. Despite many bad reviews I think CDG is a good airport with attractive areas, great terminals, clear signage and helpful staff. Onboard experience on brand new A350 was pleasant, seats were comfortable and IFE was good with a lot of contents, but I didn`t like the selection of movies. A big plus was the free WIFI message pass, so I could send some whatsapp and pictures. The main meals on both flights were tasty with a free cup of Champagne. Snacks before landing were okay, but there were no alcoholic drinks with this second food service (cost cuttings or due to pandemic?). Otherwise AF offered free drinks (tea, coffee, juice, soft drinks and water) on short-haul flights between Paris and Frankfurt. Apart from some minor negative aspects this journey with Air France was very pleasant.",Air France was very pleasant

Air France,"Short flight on a brand new two and a half week old airplane. Air France delivered great service as expected. Check in at Charles de Gaulle was quick and friendly, but the terminal was pretty full once we got to security. Boarding was very fast on this full flight. I ended up falling asleep so didn’t get a snack but when I woke up I was offered two bottle of wine by the crew. Upon landing in Madrid I was able to take a picture of the cockpit. Very nice plane with a brand new smell and friendly crew.",delivered great service as expected
Air France,"Flew Air France for the first time on Thanksgiving Day for a quick trip to Europe. Check in was a breeze since the flight was only had full, once we boarded they’re was a blanket, pillow and headphones on each seat. Most passengers had their own row, which was great since it was an overnight flight and sleep was needed. Service onboard was fantastic, tasty dinner with champagne and wine, snacks in the back for mid flight and prior to landing a small baggie with a quick breakfast was offered. Inflight entertainment had a very good choice of movies and music to pass the time along.",Service onboard was fantastic
Air France,"I purchased my ticket over 2 weeks ago. They cancelled my flight which is understandable, but when I tried to contact their customer service line, I waited for over 45mins on the line without an answer 3 times within 2 days. Finally, on the final attempt, my call was answered at 51mins waiting time. I was relieved, finally, I could speak to a human being and ask for help to my situation. The customer service rep literally said, sorry there is nothing we can do, good bye and preceded to hang up on me.",waited for over 45mins on the line
Air France,"It was very nice having a wide body with a 1-2-1 lie flat business class layout on a Moscow to Paris segment. Seats were comfortable, WiFi worked very well, and crew were lovely. However, amenities are on the zero side: no blankets / pillows or amenity kit was provided. Catering was also a bit on a low-side: salad was tasty, although no hot food on a 3.5 hour flight, only one kind of tea, not even basic things like lemon is given. CDG is a very confusing airport by its layout, although there were many staff members navigating passengers,  making the transfer efficient. A CDG - LHR leg was uneventful, a typical 1-hour intra-European hop, however, with extremely uncomfortable business class seats. A foie gras as a snack was a very nice touch. All in all, a decent experience for an EU airline. Air France nowadays seems to be a nice option to accrue a good bunch of miles subject to an attractive fare and if they schedule a widebody on a Moscow flight. However, in all other respects, I would strongly prefer KLM as a peer transit airline: they fly from LCY, their Schiphol hub is much much better for transit, the narrowbody seats are way more comfortable and staff generally better. Purely from a customer experience / segmentation perspective, AF seems to be decent, however, just not my type of airline. In addition to that, it flies into Heathrow Terminal 3: I am writing this review, standing through my first hour at passport control queue.","All in all, a decent experience"
Air France,"My experience was very horrible. First they cancelled my flight on the morning I was going to fly. They put me on an alternate flight and when I arrived on the airport, it was a huge mess. The flight was delayed by almost two hours and for that reason I missed my connecting flight from Paris. I had to wait in Paris airport for six hours which caused me to miss my train from Milan to Rome and I did not get a refund for that booking. The air hostesses on the flights were very rude and unhelpful. When I was returning back from Milan to Paris I had requested assistance which unfortunately did not arrive at all at Paris airport. I was made to wait for a very long time and yet the assistance did not arrive. I had to walk by myself to the other terminal to get the connection and had to walk very fast as my time was wasted waiting for the assistance. When I entered the flight the attendants were very rude and did not help me put the luggage away in spite of requesting it. I was asked to do it by myself as they said that they will not do it at all. Again in London I did not receive any assistance and the flight was delayed by one hour they did not seem to care for any travelers who had connecting flights. No one was informed where are flights connection will be from. I had to run like crazy to catch the flight. I was given the wrong gate number when asked by one of the Air France representative. I barely made it to the flight and then I entered the Virgin Atlantic flight to San Francisco which was operated by Air France. I was told that there are only 10 blankets for the entire flight and I will not be able to avail the facility of the blanket. The headphones were broken and unusable. I will never recommend ever to anyone to use Air France and I will not use it either. I need my money which got wasted on cancellation of train.",My experience was very horrible

They could have let passengers know of changes in advance but no one bothered. All in all more than 2 hours delay.",more than 2 hours delay
Cathay Pacific Airways,"It's my first time to fly with Cathay Pacific after 10 years. Cathay Pacific's cabin crew are the best. Their attitude and friendliness is more genuine, interacting with them does not feel fake. They can be friendly, laid back while being professional at the same time. I would like to thank Josh, senior purser, for his friendliness and fantastic service. He came to passengers in my area to ask if they enjoyed their meals, make sure they're okay, and chatted with them. Cathay Pacific's in flight entertainment option is the best curated and has the latest films and TV series. However their in flight entertainment option is inconsistent, it depends on the type of aircraft or route you are flying. What Cathay Pacific could improve on is their meal service. I wish cabin crew would give passengers the choice to choose their meals rather than serve whatever they first grabbed in their cart. But I am glad for the Manila-Hong Kong flight they are now serving rice meals compared to only sandwiches 10 years ago.",cabin crew are the best
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Flew Cathay after a long time, excellent inflight service, great entertainment and food options. Was very impressed with the cabin crew efforts to attend to everyone's needs and maintaining a courteous professional service with a smile. The only thing I felt that needs improvement is the leg space in Economy the seats are cramped close to each other and seem to be smaller, felt like there was more seats vs other airlines who use the 777.",impressed with the cabin crew
Cathay Pacific Airways,"First flight on a 777 was good, food good, service good, comfortable seats, staff excellent. 2nd flight on business class A330 was poor, business class seats, this was a regional 330, very poor, seats hardly recline at all. Dinner poor in flight movies very limited.",“staff excellent”
Cathay Pacific Airways,"The seat was broken and could not be adjusted. I paid a huge sum of money for business class for more comfort but this made it worse than an economy class seat. Cabin crews tried several times to fix the seat but with no success and said that they would report the case. The seat next to me, sat by my travel companion, was also broken as well as the two seats in front of us. This totally ruined my travel experience. I filed a complaint and they were quick to response initially, offering a reasonable compensation. Two months have passed since then and now they are unreachable in all channels. I called, emailed, and live chatted but no feedback whatsoever. This is very poor customer service from once a decent airline and such a disgrace.",very poor customer service
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Their entertainment system have more options as compared to Singapore Airlines (particularly Anime) but the most disappointed thing there was no complimentary WiFi, even for  Business Class.

Cathay Pacific Airways,"Was able to upgrade my seat to Business Calls using my Asia Miles. Seat was very comfortable and was able to get a good sleep. The crew were extremely attentive, polite and helpful regularly walking up and down the aisles to make sure everything was ok. My main gripe was with the quality of the main meals - probably the worst menu I've ever had on a Cathay flight. The idea of a pork, chorizo and pineapple burger was a BIG no, no. The lamb dish with brussels sprouts did not hit the mark (serving brussels sprouts to people in an enclosed space is never a good idea!). On the other hand the mid flight snacks were great - the beef burger was excellent.",probably the worst menu
Cathay Pacific Airways,"This was my first flight with Cathay Pacific since prior to Covid and having seen some negative reviews about a so-called deterioration in service on CX flights I was a bit worried. However, I found the service to be excellent. The crew were very attentive, polite and professional.

For sure there are cheaper air lines out there but I'm happy to pay a bit extra for a peace of mind that I'm in good hands.",found the service to be excellent
Cathay Pacific Airways,I booked an extra legroom seat and was lucky to find out that the seats next to me were not taken so I had the whole window row for myself. The flight attendants were efficient but felt a bit too serious. The meals were some of the worst I had on a plane. The braised chicken was super gamey I had to look at the menu again to make sure I did not mistakenly get the fish dish. The breakfast sandwich (that I think was chicken) was also gamey and horrible I put it back in the box after the first bite. The infotainment and the wifi were really good and kept me occupied towards the final hours of the flight.,meals some of the worst
Cathay Pacific Airways,The boarding was smooth despite the big crowd of passengers and the flight was quite comfortable. The flight attendant who was in charge of our aisle was super nice and charming and behaved like a Disney princess for the children next to me. I forgot to choose the Moslem Meal option so I was not able to eat the breakfast meal as it contained pork and attendant offered me some fruits and yogurt. Overall it was a pleasant flight.,it was a pleasant flight.+
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Shameful exploitation. As a seasoned world traveller, I have flown with pretty much all of the main carriers, and I’m pretty sure I flew with Cathay Pacific around 23 years ago to Singapore. So for my upcoming trip to Phuket via Hong Kong we chose to fly with them again (not much choice to be honest!). Having paid a considerable amount of money to fly with Cathay Pacific this time around, I was horrified and extremely disappointed that to reserve seats so that my wife and I could sit together on the 4 flights I had to pay £197.60. This is absolutely daylight robbery! How can they justify this much money for reserving 2 seats! It costs them nothing… they have already taken 1000’s of pounds for my flights and there is no additional administration needed because its all done via computer (if fact I received confirmation of my reserved seats straight after I’d paid the additional £197.60). It seems to me that they are exploiting a captive audience and playing on the fear of their travellers not being able to sit together on these long haul flights. Shame on you Cathay Pacific! This will be the last time I ever fly with CP, and I will make it my mission in life to inform my many 1000’s of contacts worldwide to do the same! Note: The date of my flight is the 5th of March 2024, so that I could leave this review I chose todays date.",“Shame on you Cathay Pacific!”

Cathay Pacific Airways,"I recently had a disheartening experience while traveling with Cathay Pacific on a connecting flight from Chicago to Mumbai via Hong Kong. Unfortunately, my baggage did not make it onto the connecting flight, leading to a series of inconveniences and frustrations. At Chicago, I was assured that my baggage would be seamlessly transferred to my final destination in Mumbai. However, upon reaching Mumbai and waiting at the baggage carousel, it became apparent that one out of my 4 luggage went missing. The entire ordeal left me deeply dissatisfied with the airline's handling of the situation. The consequences of this mishap were significant. Not having access to my checked baggage caused delays and disruptions to my plans. I had to spend valuable time at Mumbai Airport with my 6 month old infant who already flew for 24+ hours, filling out a lost baggage report and providing detailed information about the contents of my missing suitcase, taking all my baggage to customs and loading/unloading all bags at their counters. This process added unnecessary stress and frustration to an otherwise smooth journey. What further exacerbated the situation was the lack of clear communication from airline representatives at BOM. Despite inquiring about the status of my baggage, I was asked to check and recheck the conveyer belt, After a frustrating two hours with my six-month-old baby, they finally admitted that they had received information that my bag had not been loaded at HKG. They continued to blame HKG staff and demanded that I complete all formalities without offering an apology, even though I had inquired about the status of my baggage.  In hindsight, I believe there is a need for improved coordination between airports and airlines, especially during transit. The reliability of baggage handling is a fundamental aspect of air travel, and passengers should be able to trust that their belongings will reach the final destination without complications. Human error happens, but how you handle a situation like this one makes all the difference. Rather than wasting my 2.5 hours, they could have told me that this happened and that they are sorry about it but assured me that they are on top of things, and I wouldn't have been this frustrated. After all, they had already received an email about my missing bag. After spending two hours at the airport completing all the processes, I finally received my suitcase five days later (I had to buy some new goods due to the delay). The airline offered me no compensation and not even an apology. Regarding my travel, it was very pleasant and comfortable, not a single issue but would avoid Cathay in future because of such frustrating customer service I hope that my feedback can be taken into consideration for the improvement of the airline's baggage handling procedures. Travelers should feel confident that their luggage will be handled with care and arrive at their intended destination as promised.",airline offered me no compensation
Cathay Pacific Airways,"This is my first time flying with Cathay Pacific, I would never want to deal with them again. First, their mobile app is so backward comparing to other airline, the translation was so confusing, and I added my TSA number during my online check in, it wont show on their system. The staff at the JFK Counter is clueless, not polite and not helpful. They kept giving wrong information, seems like they need more internal training. and they told me there is no line on the regular security check, and I was on the line for 1 hour just because their system can’t find my TNT number, unbelievable.

The staff are just awful and miserable.",check in his bag due to the size
Cathay Pacific Airways,"First time traveling with Cathay Pacific since 2019 and the airline needs to make massive improvements to return to pre covid standards. CX216 from Manchester to Hong Kong on A350 aircraft was average, The seats in economy are narrow but do have decent legroom. The main problem is the lack of seat padding which for an eleven hour flight does not make for a comfortable journey. Cabin Crew were fairly efficient when providing food or drinks to the full cabin but otherwise absent outside these times. Food average and choices limited. CX163 Hong Kong to Melbourne was B777 in premium economy. The flight was announced as delayed once passengers were at the gate. A delay of 45 minutes was never readdressed and the eventual delay was over 90 minutes with no information provided. The plane was in need of a major refurbishment stained seats and broken meal trays were much in evidence. The sound system was very poor. Cabin service was poor and the food below average. Cathay needs to up its game as on this showing I would not be using them again any time soon. The middle eastern airlines offer a far superior product.

There were fabric-pillow, blanket and ear phones (nice quality for economy) on the seats. They offer welcome drink (even in economy) you can select alcohol as you like. Cabin crew was friendly. They do not offer amenity kit but you can ask for socks. After departure within the hour they offer first serving with selection of 2 meals. Food was very tasty. IFE is great, there is such a selection of movies that kept me awake. I saw 3 movies during the 11 hour 40 min. flight. I just had a little nap; during flight you can have a snack at the galley at rear of plane. WC is typical but there is cologne and hand cream. Wifi is with a fee, US$9.95 for 60min & US$19.95 for duration of flight. Before landing there is a second food serving. It was one of my best economy flights.",one of my best economy flights
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Check in and boarding at Hong Kong Airport well organized and efficient. The tired looking premium economy cabin is in dire need of a refit. The fold out screen in bulkhead row 30 had to be held while watching, because the tilting mechanism was broken, my neighbor had the same issue. Service after take off shortly after midnight was very slow; it took about three hours until the cabin was finally dimmed. Food was of rather average quality. Overall a rather average experience, and I am hopeful that CX will find back to its pre Covid standards.",“a rather average experience”
Cathay Pacific Airways,"The original routing was Warsaw-Heathrow-Hong Kong. I received a note 2 weeks prior to departure, that my Warsaw to London flight operated by BA would be cancelled. No alternative was offered. When I called them, I was told that the could put me on a flight 2 days before or after my original flight date. When I denied, since I had to travel on that day, was told that they could do nothing, since this is all BAs fault. When I told them that there were plenty of seats available on an earlier BA flight, they refused to do it. I had to beg them to take the first segment out of the itinerary, so I could find my own way to London. This is the first time in my life, that I had to book and pay for the same flight twice. When I approached a CX supervisor at London airport, she told me that even a ticket issue by CX, all the fault and responsibility lies with BA, so CX cannot offer any help. The flight itself was rather underwhelming for a Premium Economy long haul flight. The outdated seats are not as comfortable as newer products.",underwhelming for  Premium Economy long haul
Cathay Pacific Airways,"I had to book my flight at a short notice and CX was the only airline which was available to fly at under A$ 1500 return ticket.  Their inflight was excellent, staff were prompt, aircraft was clean, food was excellent with ice cream and good quality liquor serve generously. Every seat has their own water bottle and bathroom was kept clean as much as possible. The only issue i found that their online check in is really bad as they want all sectors including in transit. I will certainly travel again with this airline and they were consistent in service.",they were consistent in service
Cathay Pacific Airways,"After paying over £3200 for the ticket, Cathay Pacific proved to be the most disappointing flight experience I have had in a number of years. The premium economy cabin on my flights was shabby and old - and while economy, business and first had all been upgraded, Premium Economy was tired, shabby and underwhelming. Service, in general, was brisk and unfriendly. The meal service lacking and with no great differentiation to the economy offering. They had printed menus but I don't know why they bothered as some of food choices were not available and of three white wines listed, only one was available. The cabin was filthy and by the end of the flight it looked like a rubbish tip. The IFE was particularly bad and poorly designed with an unresponsive touch screen and frustrating functions. I remember fondly the days of travelling with Cathay and it being a special and memorable experience. Now it feels like Cathay is barely hanging on the the lowest standards of service, comfort and quality. This is an airline I never choose to travel with again. Cathay hands down have the best lounges I have ever been to, but here the quality stops and by the time you get on board and have been ignored and dismissed by their often rude crew, you realise that you're paying top price to sit on a budget carrier in all other respects. Give me Easyjet over the Cathay experience anytime. A huge, huge disappointment.",the most disappointing flight experience
Cathay Pacific Airways,"My flight was CX885 from LAX to HKG aboard a Boeing 777-300ER. Some things I liked about the airline include being welcomed with a full Crystal Geyser bottle of water, as well as being able to preview the in-flight meals with a menu being provided in each seat. Movies were very up to date with many that were recently released this year. This Boeing 777-300ER had a 3-4-3 configuration, the seats used on that flight were very cramped, both width and legroom. The flight attendants weren't that interactive. Service was a bit quiet, and they forgot to serve me dessert as they have served the rest of the passengers. Food was bland. Dinner especially was tasteless. They didn't provide a single amenity kit to any single passenger.",“Service was a bit quiet”
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Horrible experience. The outbound flight i was due to take was delayed meaning I'd miss my connection in Hong Kong. The staff at the desk were awful at explaining and helping us, only 1 person was allowed to allocate people to new flights despite 6-8 staff being at the check-in desk. It was so slow. In the end i got put on a turkish airlines flight, that got me there 4 hours late. No compensation was offered; since I've made several complaints, but even 6 months later, Cathay still haven't got around to replying. Their service is awful, I would not fly this airline again, they have no respect for customers.",I would not fly this airline again
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Despite the age of the plane, the refreshed economy interior was a big upgrade despite its 10 abreast layout. For someone that is relatively compact, the seat felt perfect and the usable seat width doesn't feel too bad. The only complaint is the unresponsive IFE screen. The seat phone tray is genius and the folded tray table is the best. The cabin crew were were able to move meals around the trolleys between cabins and all options were available. The only issue with the IFE is that the touch screen technology is old and the screen was sometimes completely unresponsive or hanged and you had to be patient for it to reload. On my return flight, it seemed to be slightly better.",seat width doesn't feel too bad
Cathay Pacific Airways,"I flew with Cathay from Hong Kong to Tokyo. The ticket cost about 7000 HKD. The seat was nice, but could be better. The crew were really professional. The meal was pretty nice. I flew in the morning and there was a choice of a western or local breakfast. I decided to choose the local one because I wanted to try something new from Cathay. The sauce in the stir-fried noodles was quite flavourful. The noodles were a bit dry but I thought it was a pleasant experience. The ife had some trendy movies. Overall I would recommend flying with Cathay.",crew were really professional
Cathay Pacific Airways,The flight took off on time and the on board service was on point. Nice infotainment system and good food.,on board service was on point
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Never received such bad service from Cathy Pacific. It was extremely hot day, I pressed the assistance button for a flight attendant or a glass of water, but no flight attendant showed up for 15 minutes. Finally, I asked the flight attendant for a glass of water, and she told me, she will be serving meals very soon, and finally, the water was served after about 15 minutes. After an hour, I requested a glass of water again from the same person. She again didn't serve for 20 minutes. So after about 30 minutes, I had to ask another flight attendant for a glass of water. Basically waited twice over 30 minutes just to get a glass of water. Worst service I have had from Cathay Pacific.",Worst service from Cathay Pacific
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Worst Airline I’ve flown with economy seat. Seated in front of the toilet, last row and given the last option. I requested for window or aisle and not in front of the toilet but was given the worst seat I ever had ever since i traveled to anywhere. Staff are unfriendly and one of the worst meal from Hong Kong to Narita.  Crew at the back are very loud before take Off. They need to have a serious customer service training. Seats are worn out.",was given the worst seat
Cathay Pacific Airways,"This review is for the outbound and inbound flights between Hong Kong and Singapore. First time on board CX A350. Outbound I was supposed to sit in economy, but a lady requested to swap seats with me, so I got to sit in premium economy! Very impressed with the seat features and spaciousness. Noise cancelling headset from J class was offered. 3 meal choices, metal cutlery, Hagan Daaz ice cream etc. Very good IFE full of movies and music. Service is good and food was delicious too. Inbound I sat in economy. A man in front of me requested to be off loaded to deal with a sudden family emergency. The crew handled it very smoothly and without fuss. It caused a slight delay, but we still managed to arrive a little ahead of time. Seat pitch in economy is very good, with 3 3 3 across. Excellent design of one tray for food, another tray under the IFE to hold drinks and media devices. USD port is nearby too. Each seat also comes with own power outlet. 2 choice of meals, also served with metal cutlery. All in all, I am honestly quite impressed with CX now. For many years I have avoided them because of the past experience. So glad to see they are catching up with the fast changing world.",Service is good and food was delicious
Cathay Pacific Airways,"I actually made four long-haul flights on Cathay this trip. Overall, the standard was solid four-star, rather than five. The food and drink were acceptable, if unexciting, and the seats were comfortable. But the absence of any sort of privacy screens was surprising and felt dated. All the flight attendants were extraordinarily prompt at responding to requests for service and appeared willing. I had two main issues. On the flight from Auckland to Hong Kong (11-1/2 hours, 38 seats in business, I think) there was no Champagne available after takeoff. A flight attendant told me they had only loaded three bottles, which ran out on the ground. The flight was late into Hong Kong, so I was transferred to a later flight on which I was assigned (without warning or apology) a middle seat, instead of the window I'd reserved. The absence of any privacy screen meant I spent a rather intimate 13+ hours with a stranger. He was a nice chap, but if I want a blind date, I'll go online rather than on an aircraft. I paid £5,000+ for business because I wanted Champane and privacy, so I am not too happy. Anyways, I've asked for a partial refund and was going to await a response from Cathay before posting. But Cathay has just responded: A member of our Customer Care team will review your case and respond in approximately six weeks’ time. Oh well.",I've asked for a partial refund
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Very disappointed after having flown Cathay Pacific previously with good experiences. My flight out of SFO on April 30, 2023 was uneventful except the Stewardesses made the flight miserable by serving the meals and disappearing for 2 hours. You couldn't get up to use the restroom and they were not attentive, checking on the passengers. The worst part was that the bathroom was dirty, and there was no toilet paper or paper towels. Flew home on JAL, had excellent service and clean facilities with normal size restroom.",the bathroom was dirty
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Food offerings at Seoul Asiana lounge rather poor, the wing lounge at Hong Kong airport much better. Food ex Seoul was good, ex HKK rather mediocre. Service seats and entertainment system excellent.",entertainment system excellent
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Check in and security check at BKK airport swift, CX lounge in Bangkok and Hong Kong very pleasant as always. Aircraft, seat comfort and service topnotch. What really spoiled those flights was the really poor catering. On both flights, the food was poor in quality and presentation. I did not see the Y class menu, but it looked like average economy class food on China. An example were the what the menu pompously called “a variety of cereals”, when I asked what the choices were, I was handed a small box of Kellogg’s cornflakes. So there was no variety. The same applies to wine. There is no more choice, just one white or one red, which were both dreadful. I was always very fond of CX, but this was just awful catering.",food was poor in quality and presentation
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Both flights were very pleasant, both departed a few minutes early and arrived early. The B777-300 was the version with 10 across seating and extra rows added. I was surprised I did not find much difference with the older models. I am of average height and weight and leg room/seat width were perfectly acceptable for short haul. But I would not be keen to spend an overnight flight on these seats. Service was very good and attentive. The meals tasty and plentiful. Lots of different types of IFE programming. The only problem that seems now common with most airlines is that the price for this route has skyrocketed by about 50% since January!",Service was very good and attentive
Cathay Pacific Airways,"I had high expectations but it is a true disappointment. The flight delayed, the cabin was not clean. The flight attendant were tired and demotivated. No accessories like eye blinds, earplugs. My food was terrible and seats were very uncomfortable.",a true disappointment
Cathay Pacific Airways,"They don't serve bottled waters on the plane. I took Cathay years ago and the service was exceptional, legroom was great. Now if you are on economy, the legroom is tiny. They squeeze an unhealthy amount of people on the plane and expect people to check their carry on as they have now run out of space. My tray table was not clean and their crew looked exhausted. They did not respond to the call bell throughout the flight. Pillows and blankets were provided upon request.",the legroom is tiny
Cathay Pacific Airways,"The legroom was good,  seat was comfortable with good recline, meals were tasty, and inflight entertainment was exceptional. The cabin crew were better than in 2019: they were pleasant, helpful and efficient. The 8-hour flight between Perth and Hong Kong was perfect. The 15-hour flight between Hong Kong and Toronto was better than in 2019, thanks to a new A350-1000 aircraft. However, there are still only two meal services on this very long flight, which is not enough. There really needs to be a third service with a proper snack box at the very least. Unfortunately, the toilets were not well maintained if at all, and the cabin crew need to clean them every hour or two, particularly on such a long flight. But overall I was very happy with this trip and pleased to see some improvements since 2019. It was great value for money.",great value for money
Cathay Pacific Airways,"The worst service I have experienced. I used to think Cathay Pacific was good, this time round no luck. The one staff member on the ground that I saw was quite sweet but that was another story when I hopped on the plane they were so rude. As for comfort it was pretty squished and the seats were not the most comfortable, food was average, inflight entertainment was pretty decent and the loos where clean, but the real issue happened when I landed, I get called over the intercom to come to baggage services before bags where loaded onto the conveyor belt. My good bag was not put on plane it’s coming on the next flight will be with me in two days (I wish). Three weeks later Cathay can’t tell me anything I wait the 21 days to make a claim they have no phone call service and when you do talk to someone they are so incredibly rude and blame every one else. Anyway wait the 21days fill out the paperwork on there website about claims and then get an email that someone would be in contact with me in 6 weeks approximately.",worst service I have experienced
Cathay Pacific Airways,"This is my first time flying first class on the Cathay Pacific. Baggage check in was smooth as expected. The ground staffs were courteous and handled with my baggage with care. The in-flight service manager quickly greeted me and brought me to my seat as I stepped onboard the aircraft. The stewardess offered me a welcome drink and I ordered a glass of champagne Krug 2004 Vintage Brut.  The stewardess offered me mixed nuts, a small cup of sparkling tea, hot towel, and Bamford amenity kit. The flight took off as scheduled and meal was served. I ordered the Caviar Venice and it was extraordinary with a rich taste.  After the meal, I asked for flattening my seat into bed as I wanted to take a nap.  Mattress is soft and duvet is fairly comfortable. I also requested soft pillow. Overall, the stewardesses are attentive, professional, efficient.","attentive, professional, efficient"
Cathay Pacific Airways,"We booked our flight from Toronto to Auckland on Cathay. Not an efficient route, but the fare was better than other routings and we have always appreciated the inflight service. Things went OK on the outbound flight although they rescheduled our flight several times. At least they notified us of the changes, Three days before our return flight, I went on line to check our departure time and there was a notice that our flights had been cancelled. They did not advise us, they did not try to rebook us. There was an option to click a button and request a refund only. In a panic, I called the NZ number on their website and got a message that the number was not in service. The only way I could communicate was a What’s App chat. After hours on this chat, the agent offered me a routing through New York which would get us home two days later than planned. Not great, but better than nothing. I said I would take it upon which she said it was not really available because the last leg was on American Airlines and they would need approval. She said my only option was to depart four days later on the original routing. I told her our visa expired on the original date and she said this was not Cathay’s problem. Mercifully, her shift ended and I got shunted to a new agent who was willing to try and get us on the JFK flight. She said I would have to wait for email confirmation. After an agonizing day of waiting for this confirmation, I went on line and saw that the American flight was confirmed but that the two Cathay flights were waitlisted! Back to the chat and more hours wasted to get all flights confirmed. I have never had a situation where an airline cancels your flight and that is the end of the story, I still cannot believe they did not advise us or try to rebook us without our intervention. We will never book with Cathay again as we have lost all confidence in this airline.",We will never book with Cathay again
Cathay Pacific Airways,"3 years has changed the ethos of the Cathay. I checked in from Bangkok at 4.30pm on 1/4/23 to catch a connecting flight to Narita via Hong Kong. In Bangkok I requested to be seated with my wife. The staff said that the Hong Kong Narita seating can only be changed in Hong Kong. When we reached Hong Kong we waited 30 min to be attended to and was informed that the seating could only be changed at the boarding gate. The staff were only present at 12.15am for a 1.20am flight. When they arrived, I asked about the seat change and I was just answered seat remains the same. Cannot change - that was the staff’s exact words. I just walked away and swore never to fly Cathay again. Cathay has deteriorated in quality so rapidly.",deteriorated in quality so rapidly
Cathay Pacific Airways,"After almost 8 years of not flying with them because I felt their standards had dropped. I gave them another chance and I am glad I did, they have once again improved. From Kuala Lumpur, CX uses Malaysia airlines golden lounge in Satellite terminal. Which is spacious but lacking in staff and food offerings. The A330 J cabin is the regional 2x2x2 angle lie flat designs from quite a few years ago. For short to medium haul, this is quite acceptable. In March 2023, post pandemic time, mask is no longer mandatory. Cathay once again introduces hot towels, and meals served in separate courses. Only things absent were inflight magazines, duty free catalogues and on board duty free sales. Other than that, it's business as usual. Meals were nicely presented in simple but chic white porcelain wares, with 3 mains to choose from. Our cabin was full for the day and 4 crew worked diligently to make sure everyone is happy. The flight itself was uneventful and very relaxing. I have now regained confidence with CX, and will be happy to fly with them wherever I go. After all, my home is in HK, and it's to my advantage if I fly them, as for me to have more direct flight choices and easier to collect miles.",they have once again improved
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Food was brilliant, the wine and desserts. The cheesecake with fruits on top and the 1995 Warre's Otima Colheita Tawny Port are my personal favourite. Pajamas provided by the airline, the cabin crew helped fixing my seats into full flat bed. The bed is soft yet supportive.  I had chance to order their signature cup noodles.",bed is soft yet supportive
Cathay Pacific Airways,"The kid sitting next to me was really loud and it really affected me as I wanted to take a short nap before arriving Hong Kong. I reported this to the stewardess and asked them if they can do something about it. The stewardess has kindly given me a noise canceling headphone and additional pillow for me regardless of my economy class status. I was delighted by the way the airline addressed my concern and resolved it quickly. After the food was served, the stewardess asked me again if everything was alright to make sure if I'm comfortable. Thanks for the kindness.",Thanks for the kindness

Cathay Pacific Airways,"Seats are comfortable and when the seat is full flat, the bedding is plush. Despite it's a 3-hour flight to Beijing, they offer a wide range of food and liquor options. I ordered noodle soup and it was exquisite. I tried their signature Cloud Nine cocktail and that didn't disappoint. I would love to see is more privacy by adding a sliding door for each business class/first class cabin. Some airlines beginning offering that. It's not a big deal to me but would be nice to have that option.",Not Verified |
Cathay Pacific Airways,Cabin crew attentive but not friendly. Excellent entertainment in term of quality and choice. The cabin and toilets were kept clean  Food and beverage were very good in term of quantity and service. My complaint is the leg room which was tight especially on the return flight between Hong Kong and Dubai.,attentive but not friendly
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Very pleasant flying experience, very organised boarding procedure. Excellent service, quality and quantity was very good. The product is brilliant. Heaps of legroom, comfortable reclining seat which allows for some good sleep with nice leg/feet support. The IFE is also great. Plenty of movies and series available, even pretty new ones. The cabin crew was very friendly. Whenever requested extra drinks or snacks (hot cup noodles) were provided immediately. Only downside was that through out journey masks had to be worn, even while at Hong Kong Airport. Also there were only a limited number of shops and restaurants open at HGK but this has nothing to do with the Cathay.",Very pleasant flying experience
Cathay Pacific Airways,"I had too many expectations of this company. The product is not bad, but is nothing exceptional. For example: Cathay meal trays that contain everything (starter, main course, dessert). Presentation - it's a meal tray, difficult to present something appetizing. Emirates, Qatar and Swiss to name a few: 4-course meal, served one after the other, with a nice presentation. Seat not bad, but again, nothing exceptional. Qatar Airways is better. Cabin crew very nice and attentive staff. However, the service is slow during meals. The food arrived 40 minutes after the tablecloth. I wondered if the food was on the same plane or if someone had gone to get some. The first served had finished eating, while I was still waiting to be served. The food is good. Plane modern, clean.  I am happy with the 4 flights I made with this company. Will I fly with them again? Yes, if the price is low. For a standard price, I will choose another company.",service is slow during meal
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Our international trip started wrong on December 25th 2022 when the pilot and crews of Cathay Pacific got Covid. We received a last minute notice that the flight was delayed for 18+ hours later. At the Cathay Pacific airport counter, it took 3.5 hours to rebooked us to Singapore Airlines. Upon arrival to the final destination, we lost 1 of our suitcase and neither Cathay Pacific nor Singapore Airlines want to be responsible with it. They made it hard for me to file for lost claim and has become unresponsive to my inquiry. This has been a very stressful trip and unprofessionally handled. We had to extend the trip for a full day and we were traveling with little kids. Imagine that.",Cathay Pacific Airways customer review
Cathay Pacific Airways,"I'd heard only good things about Cathay and hadn't flown them for years. Apart from trip back to Canada I won't fly them again. Check in folks in Toronto were great but flight attendants were virtually none-existent during the 14.5 hour flight. Seats felt tight, food was just OK but the kicker was the disregard for cleanliness in the toilets. They were disgusting. Sinks didn't drain, toilet seats were wet and filthy and my shoes stuck to the floor. Flight itself was smooth and on time. Cabin presence needs to be improved.",Cabin presence needs to be improved
Cathay Pacific Airways,"It was my first flight with Cathay and also with A350-1000 and that's why I chose this flight. The company changed my seat from 17A to 17K, which I was disappointed about, as I prefer a window seat.

The flight was smooth and we landed on time.",very pleasant and accommodating
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Overall it was a great experience. Being one of the most popular destination from Hong Kong, there were more people lining up at the check in counters at the Hong Kong International Airport as expected, but it was not chaotic. I was able to get my boarding pass with a waiting time of about half an hour. The ride was overall pleasant with no major issues. The cabin crew served us meal once and it was satisfactory. I also managed to sleep for 2 hours with no disturbance. The flight landed Tokyo as scheduled. Overall it was a satisfactory flight.",a satisfactory flight
Cathay Pacific Airways,Delay of 2 hours in HKG caused by operational reasons. Disappointed with service on board. Meal choice from Menu not available. During the flight except dinner and breakfast was no one time asked by the staff if anything is needed. Staff just passing by quickly not even react when waving hand. You get economy service for a business price. Only good think is the big business seat. No service besides that. Entertainment touch screen problem changing Menus by itself.,Disappointed with service on board
Cathay Pacific Airways,"The flight was about 60% occupied. The economy class seats are just alright, about the same as other airlines. The  entertainment is nice, screen is large. Plenty of movies/shows and documentaries. The cabin crew are responsive and quick to approach me when I pressed the bell for help. Meals are pretty good. I also bought the WiFi which cost $20 US dollars for the 2hr 40 mins flight. The service quality is about the same pre-pandemic. All in all, I'm satisfied with the trip overall.",satisfied with the trip
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Cathay Pacific's Premium Economy left much to be desired - cabin crew were not attentive to passengers' needs. After serving the first meal, cabin crew disappeared for the next 6 or so hours of the long flight from Vancouver to Hong Kong. No special drinks were offered to Premium Economy passengers, and only standard snacks - chocolate bars, granola bars, peanuts, etc. were offered upon request. The Boeing 777-300 ER cabin is particularly noisy, seems it is due to noisy ceiling fans. It was a fully booked flight, and cabin crew were clearly overwhelmed by the number of passengers on board. The aisles are very narrow on the Boeing 777 aircraft, since Cathay is now cramming 10 across seating in economy, so passengers can easily be run over and injured by meal and beverage carts. Overall, it was a very disappointing experience with Cathay - it is not the premium airline it used to be, and from what I've experienced, it may never be.",a very disappointing experience
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Flew on Dec 27 2022 from Toronto to Sydney to attend a wedding of my nephew. My wife's bag didn't arrive, and Cathay couldn't locate it. A friend of us works in Melbourne airport located the bag in Honk Kong a week after our arrival. It took them another week to get to Sydney. We never got the bag in Australia until we left on Jan 20 2023. The whole vacation got ruined, couldn't reach out to any help line number provided for us. We were left with zero help. The bag finally arrived to our address in Canada on Jan 27 2023! Exactly after one month lost between airports.

Would never fly with them again.",Would never fly with them again
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Cathay Pacific had gotten worse after the pandemic. This is the first time after 3 years i flew with them. Bad and rude service from the stewardess. Airplane food taste is bland from the main dish and I can only eat the bread and butter and fruits. I bought a new suitcase just to see it extensively damaged upon my return flight. Any effort to make a claim to Cathay. They completely ignore my emails, calls and direct contact. From direct contact, they will say to follow up on this, but still 2 weeks later still no update.",worse after the pandemic

Cathay Pacific Airways,"Hong Kong's strict quarantine procedure has been lifted and flights between Hong Kong and America are resuming gradually, so me and my family decided to fly to New York for vacation. Cathay Pacific was extremely thorough with its check-in procedures. At the beginning, all passengers will have to line up to have their body temperature checked before being able to get into one of the baggage check-in isles. I was flying premium economy and I had to stay with the economy class line. Fortunately thanks to the world class efficiency of the Cathay Pacific baggage check-in staffs, I did not have to wait too turn to have my turn. Check-in staff has kindly asked to check all my identifications and itinerary. Despite I was flying premium economy class, I was able to access and enjoy the Cathay Lounge in Hong Kong with my credit card. The lounge is simply top notch. Boarding was on schedule. There was a slight but acceptable waiting time at the taxiway due to the traffic. The flight was operated with a B777-300 with 34 seats in premium economy class configured 2x4x2. Half of the seats were occupied. On boarding I was offered a drink and asked for the specifically non-alcoholic mixed drink that Cathay Pacific always offers. In addition to that, the cabin crew also offered me a hot towel to clean up my hands before enjoying the welcome drink and all the facilities around my seat. A care kit was at each seat with a disposable mask and a few sheets of antiseptic wipes. The Cathay Pacific premium economy class seats are quite well designed to take advantage of the available space. It was surprisingly comfortable and a huge step above the economy class seats. For those who want a little more seat comfort, you should pay the extra bucks for upgrading to the premium economy seats! I have been flying Cathay Pacific for many years and I have seen the ranking of Cathay Pacific has been dropping significantly and people were talking about the deterioration of the service and cabin quality as opposed to other Asian airline counterparts. It was sad to hear because my satisfactory experience with Cathay Pacific has always been consistent and I don't notice any deterioration of the service and cabin quality. Cathay Pacific definitely deserves better. Last but not least, I recommend everyone to fly with Cathay Pacific Airways, whether long haul or short haul flight. I'm sure you will enjoy single moment of it. Thank you!",a huge step above the economy class seats
Cathay Pacific Airways,"This was an appalling experience. We were on a code share flight, starting in Auckland with an Air New Zealand flight to Hong Kong. We travelled business class and the Air NZ service was exemplary. By contrast, the Cathay cabin crew were a shambles and gave no customer service. They stood around with a tray of drinks as we boarded but did not offer them. The menu was disappointing and the cabin crew so badly organised that it took ages for them to serve the food. I chose fish which was fairly revolting. My wife opted for the vegetarian dish which arrived half an hour after everybody else had been served and was inedible. There was no attempt to see if we were ok or wanted another drink or coffee. I gave my breakfast order before going to sleep. My wife was not asked for her order with the result that they claimed not to have her choice (they later managed to find it). I was served the wrong breakfast and again had to ask for everything - more coffee etc. The crew seemed completely disinterested in their passengers. On a 14 hour flight the restrooms became insanitary but the crew paid no attention to them until we asked for them to be cleaned. The lack of service would have been unsatisfactory in economy class; it was unacceptable for business class.",This was an appalling experience
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Most ridiculous service, cant even check in online because of their tie up with air new Zealand doesn't allow to do so. Will never book with them again",most ridiculous service
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Poor and unreasonable baggage rules. I chose their Premium Economy service this time and I got 2 x23 kg baggage quota. I got three bags need to check in and the overall weight is within the limit but CX was rejected and said only 2 bags are allowed. I don't understand why there is no flexibility to their customer. Finally, I paid extra USD 60 for the extra check-in baggage and I haven't experienced the same handling in other airlines. Other traditional airlines always accept extra baggage as long as the overall weight is within limit. Ground service is not helpful. It is my first time taking premium  economy class and I don't see any premium service except extra legroom. Food choice is limited and no food or drink menu is provided. Poor service and overall experience.",Poor service and overall experience
Cathay Pacific Airways,"What an absence of 2 years has made. Reservation units? Almost non existent. Mostly the website or the app. Customer Care just 1 number to dial. I tried 5 times, and each call, it lasted more than one hour before i finally hang up the phone. I never got the chance to actually speak to a human . Online chat the same deal. It takes at least a good 70 minutes, before the chatbot passes the message to a real human being. If you key in from the chatbot list of FAQs, those simple answers are the same from what you find on the website, not a single extra detail more. Also watch out for number, measurement and the weight of your luggage.  Cathay implement new strict baggage rules, 1+1+1. One cabin, one check-in, and one small hand carry for economy class. Want to get 2 check-in luggage - you can, but at an additional cost. Cathay forgot to load my vegetarian meal. In flight music and TV is very limited. It is that bad.  Some of the crew that was mostly has this can do attitude before, now suddenly has the budget airlines incapacity. Poker face, less attentive, and trying to avoid interactions as much as possible. Most of the shops in the airport are close. Hope you do not wait long for your transit.",implement new strict baggage rules
Cathay Pacific Airways,Cathay cancels the flight from Hong Kong to Brisbane. I had to spend 2 hours on the phone to get another flight to Sydney.

Cathay Pacific Airways,"The flight experience was very pleasant. The online check-in process was simple. The flight attendants are all polite, hard-working, and well- mannered. The food is pretty good. It doesn’t have a large selection but the quality is good (the food is warm enough. the dinner roll is warm and soft). There’s fresh fruit and ice cream too. This is instrumental to a long flight (>14 hours) as you don’t want to feel stuffed but refreshed and hydrated. The flight is clean and seats feel very new (not sure if they did any renovation during the pandemic). The ground service of CX at the Logan airport is great. I need to take the second flight and basically had no ideas on what to do with my baggage. The ground service there told me where to go, where to claim my baggage and where to drop off and check in again. One improvement I would make is on the movie/TV selection.",experience was very pleasant
Cathay Pacific Airways,"London to Auckland via Hong Kong. I am travelling to Auckland from LHR next February, 2 pax business class. Not cheap! Given the choice of two 5-star airlines I opted for Cathay Pacific over Singapore Airlines, a decision I’m quickly coming to regret. Just over 6 months before I’m due to fly, I receive an email cancelling our flights from LHR-HKG and from HKG-AKL. I have been offered replacement flights with the second leg now on an alternative 4-star airline and, to compound matters, a 10h 40m layover in HKG. Totally unacceptable in my view. What’s more, you should try getting in touch with the airline to discuss the matter. The phone number just puts you on hold and the chat function tries to be smart but is worse than useless. I had really high hopes for a great flying experience but these hopes have been dented significantly.",high hopes dented significantly

Cathay Pacific Airways,"I've had a terrible experience with Cathay. Our flight was from Phuket to Hong Kong and from there to JFK-NY. 2 weeks before our flight, Cathay cancelled the first leg of the flight without any reason. They did not provide any alternative solution and no rebooking options. I had to work with my travel agent on my own and find a flight on my own. After 5 days of discussions with them, I managed to get us rebooked for the first leg of the flight. 12 hours (!) before our departure I received an email from Cathay mentioning that they cancelled the second leg of the flight. Again no explanation given, no support, not even mentioning anything about refunding us. I was trying to contact them but it was impossible. I booked a new flight on my own and had to pay out of my pocket. This airline is completely irresponsible and not to be trusted. This was the last time I booked a flight with them and will never do so again. I also requested a refund for the seat that I had purchased on the cancelled flight and their response was that my refund is ineligible!",This airline is completely irresponsible
Cathay Pacific Airways,"The flights that I booked for my daughter and fiancé were great, they got to the UK fine. Two days later they cancelled the flight from Hong Kong to Sydney.

They have to get an approval to replace a shorter flight they canceled even if the replacement was way longer for a Senior. Now calling again for the approval because the flight is in 2 days and the replacement flight they offered is denied. I have to buy another flight for my mom and cancel part of the flight. Cathay disappointed me a few times already. Enough is enough.",disappointed me a few times already
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Abysmal service from Cathay Pacific all around. Flight was changed, and cancelled four times, due to 'operational reasons'. I'm a patient person, I am also a pilot. I asked for a definition of 'operational reasons' and I was given nothing at all. I have a limited amount of time to get to the Philippines to see my daughter for her birthday, for the fifth rebook, CX could only offer me a date nearly 2 weeks after her birthday. Not good enough! More than most people, I know what this COVID situation is doing to the airline industry, but in this instance, I don't think they should take your money before your flight is absolutely confirmed. To add insult to injury, I had already booked a previous flight with Cathay, but through a dodgy travel agent, who told me that no changes were possible, even though I paid for a flexible ticket! So I have outlaid money twice to CX for nothing in return. Last time I contacted them, I was advised that my credit card would be refunded 'after seven working days'. It's been twelve days now, and today their staff are telling me 'up to five weeks'? They took the money off of me in seconds! To other possible customers out there, don't accept any excuses about COVID-19. Because if anything, less people are flying because of the virus, so they should be able to expedite your refund faster. Poor show Cathay; you have lost me as a customer.",I have outlaid money twice to CX for nothing in return.
Cathay Pacific Airways,"While there was a direct SYD-SFO option with UA, their price for business class was excessive and my track record with UA in flight service isn't great. So I opted for the indirect SYD-HKG-SFO routing at a much more palatable price that also helped with my oneworld status. The check-in staff in SYD were great and then immigration and security were empty and I was through to airside in no time. Of course, with essentially everything closed at SYD including all the lounges, there was nothing much to do. Boarding was swift and we were on our way to HKG in no time. Security at HKG was also empty however fortunately CX's Wing lounge was open. After the mandatory additional security checks at the gate, boarding for the SFO sector was also swift. I can only say that the Cathay crew on both sectors were outstanding, much like the days of yore when Cathay was one of the world's greatest airlines. Courteous, caring and personable, they seemed to want to go the extra mile to ensure everyone was as comfortable as possible. If this review were just about the inflight crew then they'd get top marks however what drags down the experience is the continued deterioration of the CX business class food and wine offering. Most of what I consumed was average at best although the most surprising thing was that a salad that was listed both as a supper option and then again as an anytime option, only had one serving loaded for maybe 15 business class passengers. The crew were mortified but could do nothing. I realise things are tough for CX at the moment but why tantalise premium passengers with an extensive menu if you can't deliver on it? Offer me less but make sure there's enough of everything to go beyond just one passenger and I'll be happy.",deterioration of business class food and wine
Cathay Pacific Airways,Full marks and much appreciation for a prompt and full refund of our unused flights due to Covid 19 from Paris to Hong Kong and Hong Kong to Sydney. We had a refund in our account just 12 days after we applied which was truly exceptional. So disappointed in our own airline Qantas from whom we are still waiting for a refund on a cancelled flight since first applying in March six months ago! We will definitely use Cathay Pacific in the future because of this experience and you certainly have won our admiration as customers. Thank You.,you certainly have won our admiration as customers
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Of 4 airlines that I booked for my wife and myself to LAX from MNL, Cathay Pacific was the only not to cancel our outbound flight. Little did I know what nightmares were coming. We were scheduled to return on different dates. First, CX canceled the HKG-MNL leg of my wife's flight and didn't offer any alternatives. They were content to strand her in HKG. When I called, they offered the same itinerary that my wife already had on a different date. But they wanted an upcharge of over $1,000. They finally booked on an itinerary with a 12 hour transit in HKG. No apologies, no compensation, nothing. My wife had to accept as she had to be in MNL for a work deadline. Days after, I received an email that my return flight was changed. Upon closer examination, I realized that CX stuck me with a 24.5 hour layover in HKG. Their attitude was that I accepted the change. I did not. They made the change, not me. I found out that under HK law, I'm not even allowed to have a transit that long! Not sure what CX was planning to do with me after I was denied transit in HKG. When I called, I was offered my previous itinerary on a different date but with a $2200 upcharge. I ended up having to cancel my return flight and book with a different airline. The refund, which I have not received is only 10% of my original fare after penalties. CX used to be a great airline. I will never choose it again. I've never been the victim of an airline extortion attempt before.","No apologies, no compensation, nothing"
Cathay Pacific Airways,"In March Cathay informed me that my booked flight from Ho Chi Minh City to Amsterdam couldn't take place because of the situation around COVID-19. I had to find an alternative flight back home. After 5 failed attempts, I finally found flights back to my home country. However, the extra costs I had to make were about € 3.500: the price of tickets was sky high and I had to stay a few days longer in HCM. Back home I asked my travel insurance for compensation. They told me you will have to claim the extra costs at Cathay Pacific. They could make the decision to fly via other hubs but usually that costs them a lot of money so they cancel the flight. So I claimed the extra costs. They didn't accept my claim. They told me: we informed you sufficient time before your flight, so you had all the time to find new tickets. I am really dissapointed about that reaction. Informing me in time has nothing to do with the fact that they are responsible to fly me back home. I decided never to fly anymore with this company.",dissapointed about that reaction
Cathay Pacific Airways,"The review is to do with Cathay's customer service (CS) attitude and its business ethic during the COVID crisis. They lied and refused to help those who are in vulnerable situations. 12 Jul, I booked for 9 Aug flights 14 Jul, Australia drops incoming travellers quota further. Every week I would check with Cathay if I could still get to fly - its CS told me I was fine. I have also indicated that I'm on my 3rd trimester. I would be 33-week pregnant by the time I fly. Shockingly, Cathay only emailed me 3 days before the flight date with lies that flight got cancelled. Never got a phone call. Never got offered replacement seats. I knew the flight cancellation was a lie because my mum was still got her seat on the same flight. We book our flight together but because my mum was on a business seat, Cathay split her booking ID from mine. My mother is disabled and I'm her sole carer in Australia so this outcome was the worst. Because I would be stuck alone in Thailand giving birth without close family and Mum would also be struck alone in Sydney's quarantine and she could barely speak English. From Friday 7 to Sunday 9 of August, I chatted to Cathay's CS and called them over 5 times. They all said sorry but it was up to the Revenue team to review my case. I was surprised that the authority of this matter is in the hand of the revenue team which probably doesn't work on the weekend. After the first request, all I got is one cold rejected email on Sat morning. The CS said the earliest next flight for me is 2 September, way pass my 36-week of pregnancy (you aren't allowed to fly after). This is either a lie or an act of negligent. From social media, I found out later that other Cathay passengers who got bumped off their flights after my case got offered flights much earlier than this, even as early as 11 August. I relentlessly politely appealed to the CS and begged for their help and offers them many options they can do for us - 1) Reinstate my seat; 2) Allow me to take my mum place to fly (she can be cared for in Thailand while waiting for her next flight) and; 3) Refund both of our flights so we have our fund to try to fly elsewhere. Cathay reps politely but mechanically rejected all options I asked for. They said the option 3) will cost me a penalty fee because it would be my fault to cancel to my mum's flight. I sympathise all airline businesses in this trying time. However, Cathay has proven to stoop so low to even cutback its humanity. Sure the service onboard is great. It's airport staff in Thailand also super intelligent and helpful (Deepest gratitude to Ms Phattar... who saved us at the last minute before the flight were due) but I won't recommend Cathay to anyone if you have a choice.",I won't recommend Cathay to anyone
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Hong Kong to Vancouver. I am a million - miler business traveler and have flown practically all major airlines. One airline I had not flown with was Cathay Pacific. I decided to try them primarily because of schedule restrictions and demands. My checking in process was slow but it went OK. The problems began when I got situated in my seat. First I discover that my entertainment system didn't work. I called the flight attendant for assistance, but she acted as if I was bothering her and treated me as a complete nuisance that was imposing on her iphone chatting. The wonderful experience continued with an announcement from the captain who sounded half-asleep and completely disinterested in talking to the passengers and it continued with half-hearted cabin service, terrible food, cheap wine and crackling sound from the semi-operating entertainment system. I'll spare you the details of this great experience by advising you to fly a hot air balloon before you think about spending your hard earned money on this parody of airline.","half-hearted cabin service, terrible food"

Then the airline said I can get a full refund intermediately, but now it is nearly 24h after that. Also, the airline didn't rebook for me for another flight or at least buy the ticket for me to get back in Kansas City and left me back overnight in the airports.

Cathay Pacific Airways,"Perth to Osaka via Hong Kong. Due to Corona Virus many airlines are cancelling flights to Hong Kong and waiving cancellation and rebooking fees. Cathay Pacific however will not waive the cancellation fee. They are essentially forcing me to fly through Hong Kong on my way to and from Japan, risking my health and putting me in a position where i might not be let back into Australia. If i choose to cancel i have to pay $500 in cancellation fees - its an absolute joke. Cathay Pacific is a Hong Kong based company and this is where most of their business is. They are risking peoples health and livelihood by not waiving these cancellation fees (who can afford to just waste $500 for nothing?) I phoned several different representatives to explain my situation, they are all drones who repeat the same thing, and when i eventually got put through to a manager i was on hold for an hour before they disconnected the call. They are waiving the rebooking fees however, which almost makes it worse. They are admitting there is a problem but then not allowing people to cancel their flights.

Cathay Pacific Airways,"Los Angeles to Bangkok via Hong Kong. Travel is a gift. Every touch point should evoke a different sense of excitement and thrill. Air flights are the beginnings of many touch points, and options for comfort exist. International business class is not all equal. Here's my optic of Cathay Pacific Business Class LAX-HKG-BKK and the return BKK-HKG-LAX. How excited we were to by chance be able to save our vacation travel from headaches and fly Cathay Pacific. Originally, we were set to fly PAL Business Class thru Manila to BKK; however, the Taal Volcano threw us a curve ball four days before our journey was to begin. In desperately search for an alternative carrier that would align with existing connections in BKK as well as return accommodation in BKK, Cathay Pacific held the flights. Without hesitation we booked. Now, we are not novices to International Business Class travel. EVA is our most preferred carrier, but its flight schedule did not align with our awaiting connection in BKK. We had always said that we should fly Cathay Pacific to see how it compared. It was only just nine months earlier we flew PAL for the first time and were pleasantly surprised. With that being said, we were under impression that Cathay Pacific held one up on EVA. So, perhaps Cathay Pacific would be our new go to first before EVA. Let us begin. Flight CX881 15 Jan 20 LAX-HKG departed on time. That's always a good thing. The business seat though lacks lumbar support (see photo). The amenity kit was marginally stocked with a toothbrush kit, 15ml mouthwash, Bamford hand cream plus lip balm as well as hydrating face spray, sleep mask, and earplugs. Other marginal amenities were a pair of small disposal slippers that are not quite sized to accommodate a wide foot market and a comforter. No pajamas here folks on this long haul as EVA, but to be fair PAL lacks PJs as well. Good thing though I brought a heavy cotton sweater as the cabin is kept cold, like cold cold. You learn these little things as you travel. Not all carriers maintain comfortable air. Movie selection at first appears to be vast, but upon further review, Maleficent was the only recent movie. I'm not on top of trending movies, so I named Maleficent due to TV commercial exposure. The rest are older releases with some that are ancient. Ah, not something expected. Please take time to learn what customers are seeing at the movies. A note about the interactive monitor, it is sluggish to the point of freezing up at times while scrolling. What type of dated software operating system is being used? Just saying. The dinner options were typical. Local food with some Western. When the flight attendant came to take my dinner order, she asked if I would like the burger. She then asked if I would like the seared chicken breast. That received a no. She actually looks stunned and finally asked what I would like. I ordered fish ball tung choy choy soup. For beverages, I ordered French Burgundy and water. BTW, no flight attendant comes around asking if you would like more wine.  Dessert taken was cheese along with fruit, and I asked for a cordial Cointreau. Another look of like OMG I have to work. With the flight leaving almost at midnight, there was no pre cordial anything which was not expected either. So many touch points missed. Remember this is International Business Class, not American/United/Delta domestic make believe first. A tablecloth is laid, but do not get excited.",many touch points missed

After the plane landed in Hong Kong, I went to The Bridge Lounge for Cathay Pacific and I was told that the delay for the flight CX913 has been happening for weeks now.

Having flown ANA, JAL and other Asian airlines, we decided to give Cathay's business class product a try as we had heard good things about them. Our first impression from the onset was lack of hospitality from the check in counters which gradually got worse as we boarded. The onboard FA's never welcomed us properly, didn't ask for our coats to be hung. The Flight manager came once introducing herself and we never saw her again. The crew were just pacing up and down the aisle and never once smiled. They continued with one of the worst meal offerings. The meals on a set menu weren't dine anytime options, they were pre packaged and felt the same offerings were being presented to economy class passengers. The bread tasted like it was transported from 4 flights before. It wasn't surprising to see how much Cathay had declined in the reviews. Currently, they sit at the bottom among 10 best airlines in some websites and much lower in others. It's sad to see that a premier airlines can't get the basics right. Perhaps, the can take a leaf from ANA and Singapore airlines hospitality. We flew Singapore economy on short haul flights and their service was next to superb with so much attention to details in economy! The positives at Cathay were their beds and on board IFE. The beds were very comfy with the duvets and offered good privacy. However, the cabin cleanliness wasn't great. The 777 aircraft was tired looking. The Pier lounge at HKG was great at first impression especially their tea and bar offerings. However, the lounge fell completely flat in food options. ANA and JAL lounges in Japan are absolutely amazing compared to Cathay's. I still believe in the airlines but I won't be flying unless I have experienced from other travellers that they have indeed improved their lacklustre service and food offerings.",FA's never welcomed us properly
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Hong Kong to Cape Town. Never experienced such unprofessional and rude service. About 3 hours before arrival in Cape Town breakfast was served. Hostess asked my husband if he wants Conpoy Congee with beef stroganoff or omelette, he replied omelet please. She gave him the Congee. When opened he saw it's not the omelet. She was then just serving the row behind us. He informed her he got the wrong one and asked to switch for the omelette. She grabbed the container out of his hand literally threw the omelette infront of him. My husband and I were both shocked. I wanted to do something about it but my husband asked me to leave it for now. We were both very tired after almost 15 hour flight. They do not have name tags so I did not get her name.",unprofessional and rude service
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Seattle to Manila via Hong Kong. Be wary flying this airline. Worst experience ever with no compensation or remedy. Lost our bags for the entirety of our stay in an entirely different country so we had nothing and there was no compensation or attempt to rectify. Only emails saying how “sorry” they were. Then on the day we were flying home they found our luggage and still, just “sorry”.",Lost our bags
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Gatwick to Manila via Hong Kong. Flight delayed in Hong Kong as well, their compensation was a cup of Starbucks coffee.  Arrived in Manila, my luggage didnt arrive with me. I filed a report with their staff and promised to deliver my things within 2-3 days. My luggage arrived at home after 2 days. I found that the lock was broken. After several things, I checked on my luggage again to pack my things back to Madrid. Found out that one of the wheels was detached. I didnt see this when they delivered to me. Due to the fact that they broke it and attached it again to its place so it wont be obvious that it was detached already. I made a written report to them but refused to give me any compensation. Their assistance is very unhelpful and unfriendly. Never fly with them again.",Never fly with them again
Cathay Pacific Airways,We travelled in year end from Seoul to Kolkata via Hong Kong. Firstly we were disappointed with their cabin baggage system. No baggage place for the passengers above their seat. People are are just dumping there luggage anywhere in the cabin above. Secondly the food quality was not up to the standards. Pre book meals was salty. Crew service was not at ball satisfying. Every time we travel the connecting flight from HKG is running late. Next time we will select for alternative airline.,we were disappointed
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Travelling from Vancouver to Bengaluru via Hong Kong. Flight got delayed at Vancouver. Missed the connecting flight to Bengaluru. But as soon as I landed there was immediate assistance and was provided with ticket in the next flight and also a stay at the airport till I take the next flight. Also, food vouchers were provided. Thanks to the Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon for immediate assistance and arrangements at the airport. Or else would have been stranded for 24 hours after a tiring journey. I recommend this airline.",I recommend this airline
Cathay Pacific Airways,Los Angeles to Hong Kong. The seat and new bedding were very good. The meal service was rushed and below average. The breakfast was just not good. After the first meal service no drinks were offered and the flight crew disappeared. The next time you saw the crew was at the breakfast service. I think next time I will choose a different carrier.,service rushed and below average
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Hong Kong to Mumbai. One of the worst Premium Economy Service. I flew on board CX685 on 24th Dec, my seat was 30D. Premium Economy is a joke. The seats are almost the same as size as economy, tables get stuck while folding. No welcome drink for Premium Economy passengers, no hot towel.  No separate meal selection, same economy trays and same food. Separate Premium boarding gate is only by name with anybody walking in.  Communication of crew poor. I would strongly suggest fliers not to waste money on Cathay Pacific Premium Economy.",worst Premium Economy
Cathay Pacific Airways,Brisbane to Colombo via Hong Kong. In flight service ok but I booked a return ticket with short transit. They suddenly changed or advanced return day so that I am going to miss the most important part of the trip. When I requested a day later they said that day sold out - on their website still tickets for sale. They do not consider customers requirements.  Think twice if you fly with Cathay Pacific.,do not consider customers
Cathay Pacific Airways,"I booked a flight on their website and cancelled within 20mins (as per their policy of a full refund if cancelled within 24 hours of booking) because I realised it was only valid for 6 months. However, the airline has been finding every excuse they can to not refund me the full ticket. They have charged me a penalty of $550 even though it is their policy to provide a full refund. This is their latest response:  Thank you for your patience while waiting for our reply. We were investigating this matter with our online booking team and were awaiting their response. They have checked your son’s flight reservation, under airline booking reference xxxx and ticket number xxxx and have advised that your booking was made on the Australia website. So unfortunately, the cancellation fees do apply and we are unable to refund them. We know this was not the answer you were hoping to hear, but we are sorry. Thank you for contacting us.",not refund me the full ticket

Cathay Pacific Airways,"Brisbane to Delhi via Hong Kong. Service was attentive and very polite, staff greeting you by name. Meal service was wonderful, staff taking your orders on a tablet before bringing food to your seat without a trolley. I never thought a hamburger on a plane could be so good but they managed to do it very well, the only downside was the chips which were below average. Drinks were nice, and the champagne upon boarding is a lovely touch. The flatbed seat was really comfortable and I managed to sleep quite well. The lounges at Hong Kong were incredible, and I made a point of visiting several. Highlights include the tea room where you can have your choice of tea brewed in a very spacious and tranquil room. The shower rooms were spacious. Service at the bar was great. The only disappointing thing at the lounge was the noodle bar which really didn't do much for me despite yum cha and noodle soup you can expect all over Hong Kong. They even have a meditation corner which was a nice way to relax. The egg tarts were okay, but nothing to write home about. Can't really comment on value for money as this was a points redemption, however, I generally find the cost difference between economy and business is much better spent on the ground at your destination. My only complaint was that my bag was mishandled and delayed as a result. It was handled so poorly that both the check-in bag tag, and a personal tag on mine were missing from the bag. They found it reasonably quickly and I had it a couple of days later, but my follow up emails about the missing tag went unanswered for weeks despite repeated attempts by me to contact them.",attentive and very polite
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Sydney to Incheon via Hong Kong. I went on holiday and on my way and return, my flight got delayed and hence missed both connecting flight. The worst thing was that my dad was travelling with me as his brother - my uncle - was in critical condition. And we missed his passing just because of the delay. And no one was empathetic at all! The staff was so rude that it made grieving so much worse.",The staff was so rude
Cathay Pacific Airways,"The flight from Hong Kong to Barcelona on 9th December 2019 was a nightmare. After a 11 hours flight from Auckland to Hong Kong I find my next flight to Barcelona is delayed for 3 hours. The company didn´t provide any explanation regarding this issue. Once we are all passengers in the queue after 3 hours the crew informs us that the flight will departure at 4:30 am (one and a half hours more for us to wait!) Again, no explanation. They didn´t offer any refreshments or any free meal, there was such a lack of communication from their side! Finally, we got in the plane by 5 am, after almost 1 hour waiting inside the aircraft the pilot informs that, due to technical issues, the engineers are not able to fix the problem and we have to get off the plane. They re-scheduled the flight and the departure was to take part at 11 am - almost 12 hours delay. they new about these technical issues from the beginning, however, they decided to keep us waiting all night without proper rest, pending on news that we never got. I´m asking Cathay Pacific for compensation due to such a huge delay and their answer is very unrespectful since they say the reason for the delay was that the incoming flight was late.",was a nightmare
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Melbourne to Zurich via Hong Kong, returning to Brisbane. Premium Economy on Cathay is almost always a pleasure, not just for what it provides (extra leg room, welcome drinks, hot towels, feeling of spaciousness) but for what you don't get (you tend not to get screaming babies, yobbos, tour groups, unruly kids, etc!), So, if on business, this is a very good option. Cathay fly to places one actually needs to get to, in my case, Zurich. All flights on-time or very early. All food options good. Quality service from a very attentive cabin crew on all flights. As a One World Emerald member I had access to the superb Qantas First Lounge in Melbourne and, of course, various Cathay First Class Lounge offerings in Hong Kong. Cathay also uses the Aspire First Lounge in Zurich and this is quite superb. My only gripe is the on-board IFE - I never find anything worthwhile to watch, except the live News Streaming - but that often doesn't seem to be in range. Highly recommended, especially on the new A350-900 or A350-1000 aircraft.",very attentive cabin crew
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Hong Kong to San Francisco, in Business class. Overall very good. Flight to San Francisco was delayed of more than one hour, but plenty of information given and arriving destination almost on time. Flight back almost one hour earlier than expected in Hong Kong. No issue with luggage. Business seats on Cathay Pacific are quite unusual, every passenger is in a sort of square box, seat inclined 45^. Strange but very functional. Lot of small storage spaces, seat becomes a flat bed, wide and long enough even for me (1.90). Very large screen, and lot of recent movies to look at. Privacy is good and each seat has independent access, you are not disturbed by other passengers. Might be a problem if you are not travelling alone as myself... almost impossible to communicate even with the person seating on your side. Food and beverages of good quality. Cabin crew is very kind and available, no problem with English. But quality of service was not top-level as expected. Some short cuts were below standard. Meal served with a plastic tray, no choice for bread, almost no refills for drinks. Worst problem, slow service. Not good, and surprising, as on the sister company, Cathay Dragon, service was really perfect.","Worst problem, slow service"
Cathay Pacific Airways,Hong Kong to Melbourne. Squeezed like sardines in coach. I know that coach is coach but it is rarely so bad. Service was very poor. The staff was unfriendly. They hardly proposed any water during the 9 hour flight. I have a hard time to understand why this airline has such a good rating. Disappointing!,Service was very poor
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Hong Kong to Barcelona. We had the flight at midnight but was delayed for 3 hours then we asked to the staff but didn’t have any idea for give us an answer and we explained them that we have other different fly in Barcelona 5 hours late that we supposed we arrived, but they don’t care about it. However after they said that the fly was delayed one hour and a half more how that it’s possible they didn’t prevent this ones. They didn’t answer to the customer anything just we don’t know, then we coming into the plane at 5 am (5 hours late) and the pilot said that the inconvenience continue and we have to take the next fly at 11 am? Who is responsable about it because we miss our other flights we lost the money ? It’s very disappointed travel like this first and last time that we travel with this company.",very disappointed
Cathay Pacific Airways,San Francisco to Osaka via Hong Kong. Our luggage arrived at our destination with 1 less wheel (picture attached). i could just imagine how roughly it was thrown around.

Cathay Pacific Airways,"Jakarta to Hong Kong. Cathay Pacific did not deserve to have their 5-star rating on the service they provided during my flight. Though the airplane is good, lots of heir competitors also have similar airplane serving the particular route. Flight attendants are adequate, they are helpful but not friendly. Food is terrible, the taste is very bad and the menu is very bad. Seating is comfortable and quite good, and there is no complaint to be made here. Along with in-flight entertainment, it is quite good and quite complete.",not deserve their 5-star rating
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Flew business class from Hong Kong to Los Angeles. Window seat 18D CX884. The cabin crew especially the older women undermined me and tended to others more and gave me a shabby look.  It was overall a great experience except the part where my supposedly priority baggage had a huge dent leaving it unsealable after opening it once but it's ok - Priority baggage does not make a difference for Cathay, it comes out even later. Some other cons are, no pajamas, no slippers, limited and bad toiletries, small bathroom, food takes long","no pajamas, no slippers"
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Hong Kong to London. Check in was a breeze at the City Centre in Hong Kong, and staff was friendly. The lounges were the highlight, with massage, private day room, and the Cabana was beautiful with its own bath and daybed. The lounge food was satisfactory. However in comparison with Lufthansa first class terminal, the food was pretty subpar. There was no private transfer of course from the lounge to the plane either. For the flight itself, there was no accompaniment to the seat, just a 'turn right' by the purser. Both flight attendants were polite, friendly, and helpful, but no going the extra mile. I was greeted by the latest upgrade of the inflight amenities that Cathay highlighted in their latest 'Let your senses guide you' campaign: The seat itself is the same with its spaciousness and is extremely comfortable.  The new Bamford kit is nice, and the new bedding is comfortable, but no more than before. The pillow is too large, but the red small cushion is soft and a pleasant addition. The welcome drink is downgraded from champagne to a small glass of comparatively cheap Jing tea! Then came the meal itself: the same caviar with champagne that was not well chilled, lobster main course sounded great on the menu but came out exceedingly bland and tasteless. No cheese was offered voluntarily by the staff. The dessert of passion fruit pie was sickeningly sweet and disgusting. After dinner, chocolate was given out but then retrieved as I slept so I had to ask again afterwards. All in all a very disappointing dinner. That is in line with my last meal with Cathay in Business, which was inedible. The flight overall was very bland, and nothing special, unlike the First in Lufthansa or Swiss, which was classy and luxurious. In summary, the latest revamped First is disappointing with cosmetic changes and suggestive of cost cutting, not worthy of a full first fare. My senses would not guide me there!",revamped First is disappointing
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Bangkok to Boston via Hong Kong. I would not recommend this airline, especially if you have specific meal requirements. They don’t let you select meal options when you are booking and then you can’t specify it during check-in unless it is 24 hours earlier. Staff is very rude if you even try to talk to them about it during check-in. In today’s age, it is hard to believe that after you book your ticket you have to call an airline to provide your vegetarian meal preference.",would not recommend
Cathay Pacific Airways,"San Francisco to Bangkok via Hong Kong. My flight was cancelled on Nov 13, 11.45 pm to Nov 14, 11.05 pm but they use the word reschedule to not be responsible to the passenger. They do not have hotel to support the passenger just told us go home and come back tomorrow. If you are the tourists you have to find your hotel by yourself. Actually my previous flight from Bangkok to Los Angeles via Hong Kong was horrible also, the toilet on the plane was not available since I was on-board and they don't fix it. The rest was really dirty and I have to wait for a long time to use the toilet. Such a horrible airline. Can't believe Cathay has poor standard and service like this. I am very disappointed.",Such a horrible airline
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Hong Kong to Toronto. In advance I paid extra for a seat with extra leg room, beside the exit door . In Bali (my previous destination) I broke my foot right before the flight to Hong Kong, not knowing it was broken I boarded the flight of 5 hours in excruciating pain. Once I landed I realized it was broken - Immediately called my doctor back home and asked what I needed to do. I didn't have travel insurance so I could not afford to go to a hospital. He instructed that I elevate my leg and ice it on the plane. When I arrived at the boarding gate in a wheelchair the flight attendant said nothing to me about changing my seat from the exit row, not until we were boarding on the ramp did I realize my seat was moved. At the door of the plane I asked why this was. They told me because I couldn't help in the case of an emergency. They put me in a middle seat behind this exit aisle. When I requested a change of seat they said there was nothing left but Economy Plus - something I would need to pay for if I wanted extra room.  I had no choice but to upgrade my seat to ensure my leg was elevated (can you imagine a 15 hour flight with no pain medication and the cabin pressure causing extreme discomfort... well don't worry this airline can't imagine it either). They charged me $2,600 Canadian dollars to is in a seat that had leg room. I hope someone from this airline looks into this because I am very dissatisfied with your customer service.",I didn't have travel insurance
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Hong Kong to Jakarta. If you wish to fly with your family or friends but don’t want to sit next to them during the flight, then book Cathay. They never put you in the seat next to the people who book the tickets together with you unless you want to pay more in advance (happened to me more than once). You will also get cold and useless service from the moment you check in and during your flight, until you land at your destination. Plus, the food also tastes bad. I hope I will never have to fly with Cathay Pacific ever again.",cold and useless service
Cathay Pacific Airways,"London to Manila via Hong Kong. We booked our flights via this airline because it was the best value and good flight times. All four flights were excellent. Staff at all stages were friendly and helpful, the food was pretty good, plenty of leg room, and huge amount of choice of inflight entertainment. Not at any stage of our travels did we find an issue or find anything didn’t meet our expectations. Great value flights, would definitely use again and recommend to others, don’t be put off by the bad reviews. Cheap and cheerful.",Great value flights
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Adelaide to London via Hong Kong. My wife and I travel regulary with Cathay Pacific and have always been very pleased with all aspects of their service. We have tried other airlines but have always returned to cathay pacific. This August on our return trip we opted for a longer stop over in transit (12 hours) so we could take a visit to Hong Kong centre and have lunch etc. On our return to the airport we found the departure gates all closed as there were demonstrators all over the airport blocking departure gates. All the flights were showing cancelled on the information boards, so we just sat in a corner and waited for any news. Some of the demonstrators walked round giving people water and food, and apologised for the inconvenience being caused, they were not hostile at all. After several hours and no news that the flight would be going we decided to get the train back to the city and book in a hotel, as we was just about to go out the building my wife and was approached by two young ladies in Cathay pacific uniform and asked us if we were with CP, when we told them yes one of the ladies along with a young man without uniform chaperoned us to area A of the airport where there was another small departure gate. They spoke to some security people and we was slipped through the gate unbeknowing to demonstrators, on the plane only lost half hour. Were flying again this December with no qualms.",pleased with all aspects of their service
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Sydney to London via Hong Kong. We found the check in staff and cabin crew nowhere near as friendly as other airlines we flew in Business Class. Business Class meals are very poor quality and selection, they seem to cater for more Asian people in the meals, so in future we will use other airlines. Even their inflight entertainment selection is inferior to others, only good thing is the aircraft comfort. I will add a photo of the meal choices for the London to Hong Kong section. We flew from Sydney to London return and all the Business Class meals were below standard, many times only on plastic trays compared to other airlines who serve from a trolley. We won’t fly with Cathay again, other airlines for Business Class are far superior.",We won’t fly with Cathay again
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Hong Kong to New York JFK. The economy cabin had rows of seats 3 x 4 x 3. It felt cramped. Service was satisfactory. A large library of films was available for viewing - decent headsets were in the seat pocket. On the seat, itself were a blanket and pillow and the seat reclined sufficiently. A menu card was distributed. Lunch and dinner were served and in between in the galley area, a wide selection of snacks, non-alcoholic beverages, eyeshades and socks were laid out. Bathrooms remained clean during this long flight. Flight attendants were efficient. Duty-free products were hawked but there was really nothing to buy from the catalogue on a flight to the US! Departure and arrival were on time. At the boarding gate, passengers were subject to additional security screening. The biggest drawback to the economy seats is obviously the tightness of space, including storage space around you (overhead bins are spacious on the 777-300) and the total lack of privacy. Just turning on the overhead lamp to read a book lights up the entire row. Overall, however, Cathay Pacific does well to ensure that economy class passengers have decent travel experience. We arrived in Terminal 8. Disembarkation was quick.",Service was satisfactory
Cathay Pacific Airways,"I was flying with my family of 4 with 2 young kids from London to Nagoya via Hong Kong on CX0256 on 20th October. One of the stewardesses was especially rude to my wife, a Japanese national during dinner service. As my wife was on headphones and also attending to my 3 year old daughter, she might have not heard the stewardess asking her for her choice of meal. She then shouted ‘Dinner!, What do you want?’, needless to say my wife was taken aback. My wife also noticed that she asked a another lady sitting just across from her in a polite manner and wondered about this difference in treatment. A few hours later, my wife requested for a blanket for my daughter and herself through the call button and she then came back with the blankets and placed them right in front my wife’s face, shouting ‘Blanket!’. By this time I was rather agitated at her behavior and pressed the call button as well. The same lady came by my aisle which I found strange as it was not her service aisle, I requested to see her supervisor. Instead of her supervisor, she sent her colleague instead which I recognized from the same uniform. I eventually met with her flight supervisor and inflight supervisor for the flight. I was also informed by the inflight supervisor that I could also make a formal complaint. After the flight, I made a formal complaint via their online portal. A customer service executive attended to this case. Cathay Pacific offered an apology and did not try to pay any other offers of compensation through miles or vouchers on this incident.",did not pay any compensation
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Flight from Amsterdam to Hong Kong in Premium Economy. It was the first time that I was flying CX Premium Economy, and I was impressed. The seats were very comfortable - they had generous legroom (it seems that the pitch was more generous than on most other airlines offering Premium Economy) and a leg rest that is also useful if you are more than 6 ft. tall. The meal service on CX is different than in Economy, and I enjoyed the meal that I had. The service was attentive without being persistent. It was one of the best (if not the best) Premium Economy products that I have experienced so far.",I was impressed
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Flight from Hong Kong to Amsterdam on Cathay Pacific in Business Class. Cathay has reverse herringbone seats in a 1-2-1 configuration. I found the seat to be very comfortable for sleeping. In particular, I had plenty of space for my feet and legs. Furthermore, there was adequate storage available.

Nevertheless, if the price is right, I would happily choose Cathay Pacific again.",service was very attentive
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Dublin to Hong Kong. Disappointed. I flew good few times with Singapore Airlines and wrongly assumed that all Asian airlines are of the highest comfort. The crew is nice, but just the formal way of nice. No joy in the way they treat you. No going up and above. No personal touch. The food is acceptable, but that’s it. It’s no good but not bad either. Average and bit dull. The seat is fine. The only highlight was the entertainment system. It was awesome! And I loved the cameras. Definitely worth its price, but nothing else.",Average and bit dull
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Melbourne to Hong Kong. A bit disappointed considering that Cathay is a 5 star airline. I know that this trip was in economy and I did not expect business class However, no water was brought to us during the long flight and the entertainment system was not working well. I used the call button but nobody showed up. Cathay is good in business class but not in economy class.",A bit disappointed
Cathay Pacific Airways,Paris to Melbourne via Hong Kong. The best part takes place before flying. You can phone any published landline number at any time of day from any location and get through to someone in 20 seconds. You can pay in any currency at the spot rate at that moment. The confirmation e-ticket and Locator number arrives by email before the end of the conversation. Qantas typically has over an hour wait time and they charge extra to speak to a human.,can pay in any currency
Cathay Pacific Airways,"London to Sydney via Hong Kong. From check in through to boarding and the flight, the experience was identical. This does show a level of consistency with the airline. On the flights themselves the CSM was superb in checking in a couple of times on each leg. Brought over a cappuccino in a china mug with some biscuits also at one point. The London Cathay lounge is fabulous. A compact version of their lounge in HK. The noodle bar is great and had some dim sum plus noodles from there plus use of the shower facilities. Great buffet also. My 'home' lounge is Qantas right next door but equally happy to use Cathay. Cathay are a great airline and my default choice to Europe if not flying on Qantas. Only downside - the noisy B777 jet but nothing can be done about that.",show a level of consistency
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Sydney to London via Hong Kong. This was a return to Cathay after a couple of years. Being a OneWorld airline I can accumulate points and status credits to go to my Qantas account. Overall the experience on CX is satisfying. From check in (at the CX First counter on account of being a Platinum with Qantas and One World Emerald. This is important even when in the economy cabin). Lounge was familiar at Sydney being the Qantas First. Boarding painless. Now the aircraft is one that is love - hate. It is the 777 - 300. Comfortable ride but its downsides are well known. 10 abreast seating a cabin that is narrower than the Qantas A380's i'm used to and oh boy is the 777 a noisy jet. By comparison the 380 is whisper quiet and the 777 sibling, the 787 Dreamliner is quiet also. The economy seats were fine although the padding was a little firm. The IFE is very good but loaded up with Netflix I did not really use it save for the excellent maps. Now being an Emerald One World, the CSM was very attentive. Three individual cabin crew introduced themselves including the CSM. It's a very nice touch from an airline that I do not often fly with but shows the advantage of One World membership. Of the other OW airlines I fly with (American and British) only Cathay gave such attention. The F & B was not really sampled as I had eaten in the lounge. But it looked fine. Overall the flying part was satisfying except for the loudness of the 777! Now HK airport is one mighty big place. I had a 4 hour layover and headed to the Wing which is one of Cathay's flagship lounges. It was 5.30 am in the morning so the rest of the airport was closed. Separate review of the lounge. Cathay is an airline I'll definitely be using more in the future.",definitely be using more
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Hong Kong to Singapore. I found the Cathay proposition to provide excellent value, 10k miles redemption for a 4 hour flight. Ground check-in was seamless, zero queues. Seats in economy certainly are average, but I'm sure I've had it worse with some other airlines. I was comfortable enough to sleep for 3 hours on this flight and the only remaining time awake was meal time. IFE had a vast selection of options and these were new systems installed on the slightly older planes. They still offer some of the widest and most varied destinations coupled with reasonably good service. Not the best, but good enough for what I paid.",good enough for what I paid
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Singapore to Hong Kong. Cathay had long relied on their name. While the cabin crew and flight crew continue to offer professional service, it can only be a matter of time before Cathay becomes a Chinese domestic airline. Take that comment as you will - all Chinese carriers today are all terrible and what with HK it's a matter of time. My last business class was in the now defunct Jet Airways and I would prefer that over what I experienced today: 1) No wifi. 2) Movies and TV are biased towards Chinese / HK releases with family oriented fillers in the English section. Disappointing to find absolutely nothing to be watched. 3) A lacklustre menu, but I went for the fillet steak. If you like stringy, stewed and overcooked steak with a taste of low cost cooking oils then this is is tour flight, tepid gravy with a skin, tepid potato scooped tasting of oil not butter. 4) Mediocre seat not designed for anyone over 5.5' The transfer information screen really sums it up. All the fights are there, but with no actual usable transfer information. Lounge experience equally poor. We talk of Emirates going downhill, but why not when the competitors drop to this. Put your money back in your pocket, buy a Scoot ticket with all the addons. You aren't missing anything.",Cathay had long relied on their name
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Perth to Hong Kong. It used to be a great airline; in fact it used to be my favourite airline. But Cathay has gone from bad to worse. I'm not really a big guy (185/85kg), but I suffered in that tiny economy seat. Behind me was a similarly tall guy, whose knees were constantly in my back. I could barely move in that seat and I'm surprised that there are no restrictions as to how small a seat can be. But looking at the 'Premium Economy', I know what Cathay economy used to be. The other aspect is food and beverage. For a long-haul flight of more than 7 hours I expect decent meals and good supply of at least water to prevent dehydration. Neither was provided sufficiently. Especially the breakfast was a total joke. I'd be ashamed to serve that. As far as hydration is concerned, I asked twice to get more water and was ignored. In the morning I asked for more coffee and was ignored as well. Does the crew have too much stress? They used to be a lot more caring, attentive and forthcoming. The only advantage I felt was the 30kg baggage allowance, but even that becomes more and more of a standard and does not give Cathay an edge over other airlines. I hope Cathay can find back to its former glory. For now I'll try to avoid it.",Cathay has gone from bad to worse
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Sydney to Hong Kong. For Business Class they are way below the other airlines for meals and crew friendliness. Imagine our disgust when dinner was a choice of prawns or a hamburger with soggy chips! It’s a disgrace and served on a plastic tray. The seats and cabin are fine, but we have been spoilt by the crew of other airlines, Cathay fall way short. This is the first leg of our Business class trip to Paris return, not a good start",way below the other airlines
Cathay Pacific Airways,"I choose to fly Cathay Pacific from Manchester to Phnom Phen with my school. It was a wonderful experience. The aircraft from Manchester to Hong Kong was modern and new. The seat was comfortable and equipped with personal in-flight entertainment screen. The IFE contained large options of films, TV shows and Music. The seat itself was comfortable and adjustable with headrest. The seat provided a pillow and a blanket with headphones. The seat pocket contains everything that every long-haul airline standard have (magazine, safety card, sickness bag, shopping magazine etc). The crew handed out a menu which is very useful for making meal options. The flight departed on time from Manchester and lunch service was provided an hour after took off. The food was delicious and of a high standard. The crew were really friendly and motivated. They constantly providing refreshments for passengers for a whole flight. This is an overnight flight so the cabin lights dimmed very early. The dimmed was through out the flight until the breakfast service around 3 hours before landing. The toilet was modern, clean and have good facilities. The breakfast service was fast and like lunch service, the food was delicious The flight arrived on time in Hong Kong. The first flight is really impressive long-haul flight. The transfer process in Hong Kong is easy and fast. I took my second flight to Phnom Phen with Cathay Dragon. The seat is really comfortable and the aircraft equipped with air vents. The onboard service is good with a complimentary drink and mid-flight snack, but the crew weren't really friendly and didn't hand out all papers to hand into Cambodian immigration. The flight depart and arrive on time. Overall, I was really impressed with Cathay Pacific, despite a minor fault, I would fly with them again.",really impressed
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Dublin to Brisbane via Hong Kong. We have previously flown with Cathay Pacific in their Premium Economy class and we decided to upgrade to Business Class. The comfort level in Business Class in wonderful with a very comfortable seat, lots of leg room and a seat that converted to a flat bed. The Business class seat has amble compartments for your personal items along with charging station and good quality headphones. The entertainment offered on the flight was a little disappointing and I felt was a limited selection, my recollection from previous flights with Cathay was that the range of entertainment offered was larger and has since diminished. The customer service is fantastic and the cabin staff should be commended, as well as the ground staff, who I have found to be timely and efficient. The only criticism that I have is that I found it difficult to sleep due to the constant flow of cabin staff who made their way to the kitchen area. I understand that the cabin crew are very busy, however I wondered whether the traffic during sleep time could be minimised. I would recommend Cathay Pacific to my friends, and I would also recommend business class.",I would recommend Cathay Pacific
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Hong Kong to Rome. To my surprise, I thought A350 economy seating should be much better Seats space are terrible, not much different than AirAsia seating. The seat reclining angle is also very limited, I can hardly get any eye shut for my 12 hours flight. Inflight entertainment selection really poor as well, not much movies or classic blockbuster available. The flight departed late for more than an hour. Food is just meh.. I thought I made a good choice for choosing Cathay flying their latest aircraft, but it was really a bad option, only good thing out of this flight is a direct flight from China to Rome due to business schedule. From now onwards, I will avoid taking Cathay A350-1000 economy.",it was really a bad option
Cathay Pacific Airways,Hong Kong to Singapore. The food was spectacular! The seats were nicely furnished and they were surprisingly comfortable! I would recommend the airline as they are very kind and they have patience as well with kindness and happiness!,food was spectacular
Cathay Pacific Airways,Manchester to Hong Kong. Amazing service. The premium economy product was faultless. The seats were amazing as was the mini cabin. The food selection was something out of a high end restaurant. Constantly offered drinks and snacks. Will use again without a doubt,The seats were amazing
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Booked the trip as far possible out as I could so I think it was value for money compared with other airlines. The A350 being a new aircraft is great to fly in. Best features about the flights Lie flat bed great for me being 6 feet plus, no need to ask a crew member to make the bed up. Managed to sleep quite easily. Crews on all legs, polite, courteous and workmen like (no unnecessary chit chat ) addressed by my name and cabin staff introduced themselves. The privacy of the cabin is excellent. Food - I would say average plus, tried the Beefburger and Chips (It didnt work for me). Minor grumble no additional breads offered any more at the main meal or breakfast and I had to ask for coffee, otherwise I would never get one. Great showers in the Wing at Hong Kong airport. When it runs well Cathy is a very good airline.",A350 is great to fly in
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Washington DC to Hong Kong. Boarding was done efficiently and we were shown to our seats by cabin crew. The purser came up to introduce herself and happened to be a very chatty Japanese lady who was sweet and helpful. The seat was comfortable but I was surprised by the lack of storage space at sitting level. There was a small storage box at the bottom of the seat and one by the armrest, which I didn't dare use for fear of leaving stuff behind. The flight left on time and we had options of a quick supper or a full meal. I opted for the former and was served a rack of lamb which was beautifully cooked. The accompanying vegetables were overcooked and I was surprised that service comes on a tray instead of being brought out course by course. There was also no dine on demand but there were snack options available throughout the flight. There was no mattress for the seat so that was a minus for me. Otherwise, the pillows were adequate and there was a duvet which I didn't use as I found the cabin too warm. The IFE was good and responsive and we were given good quality headsets. There was a very basic amenity kit provided. The crew were proactive and responded to calls quickly and were always pleasant. There was breakfast before landing which again was served on a tray and there was no spoon provided to stir my coffee! Overall, I like flying Cathay but it pales in comparison to the Business class product of Qatar airways. It was a 'no-frills' business product but then again, the seats were quite comfortable, crew were nice and the plane was clean and brand new.",no-frills business product
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Zurich to Tokyo via Hong Kong. I chose to upgrade my Economy Seats for one way from Zurich. It was one of the best flight experiences I've had in business class so far. The seat was retractable into a flat position so that it could function as a bed. The return flight was unfortunately booked out completely, so that I had to return in economy class. Which was not a bad experience after all, and it was my own fault in the first place as I had not booked business class in advance. Fortunately at ZRH airport, upgrades could be made directly at the gate. The food was very good in both classes, however there was the additional option of ordering food at any time in business class, which was a nice perk, but haven't really taken advantage of because the lunch, dinner and breakfast was more than sufficient to satisfy my hunger. The in flight entertainment system was extremely well designed, and the selection was huge. I would 100% recommend this airline, and I'm looking forward to possibly fetch a good deal on a business class flight from Zurich to Tokio next month again.",would 100% recommend this airline
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Shanghai to Barcelona via Hong Kong. The 1st flight was late, so we barely caught the 2nd flight. I made it, but my luggage didn't. They told me that they will only be able to deliver the suitcase 2 days later. I was instructed to call the airlines for the compensation. The service is terrible. They never pick up their phone calls and never respond to the emails. No one cares. It is so frustrating. My suitcase was supposed to be delivered 2 days later at 1.30 PM, then in the evening, then the following day in the morning. Seems like I'm never going to get it back. I would not recommend this airline to my worst enemy.",would not recommend this airline
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Cebu to Dubai via Hong Kong. The flight was delayed by more than an hour in Cebu but the consolation is that we were upgraded to Premium Economy for Cebu-HKG route. I hate delayed flight, they did not provide any drinks or snacks, fortunately, I have access to the Premium Lounge courtesy of my MC. The flight was comfortable, the legroom and the seat pitch was good enough. The HKG-DXB route was not quite interesting, food served was bland and the plane cabin was not neat as expected. The handling of the crews aboard the flight is very average.",we were upgraded
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Hong Kong to Washington. Transit in Hong Kong on 31st August after arrival from KUL. Premium Economy on Cathay Pacific does not allow lounge access. Boarding process was a mess. They announced boarding was about to start and pax were lining up but then delayed boarding for at least 45 minutes citing security issues. In the meantime, I was questioned by a young security staff asking me silly questions about my trip. He was rude and repetitive and cold hardly speak English. When we finally boarded, the flight was delayed and only left the gate about 50 minutes after departure time. On board, the PE seats are a fail in my opinion as they are definitely not 20 inches wide and appear no different to an economy seat in terms of width. I have flown Premium Economy on the Cathay Pacific 777-300 and although they are older type seats, they are wider. The seat pitch is good as is the recline but when the passenger in front has their seat reclined, it gets very tight. The leg rest is a bonus and as I was in a window seat, the seat is jammed right against the window leaving no space to store blankets etc. The IFE was good and very responsive. The screens are large and crisp and there are additional storage spaces below the IFE screen. The seat pocket is very low down and limited in what it can hold. Basically storage is a problem. The food is the same as economy, small portions but I ordered a kosher meal which was delicious and plentiful. The staff were pleasant and better than the KA staff o the previous flight and were present throughout the flight. There were snacks available during the flight but the offerings were limited. Deplaning was was uneventful. Overall, Premium Economy has very little to boast about when compared to economy on CX.",very little to boast about
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Hong Kong to Singapore. The experience is nice. The premium economy seat allows me to lying down to a large angle (much better than economy seats). The space between each seats are greater. Noise cancelling headsets are provided. It's worth the price especially if traveling on long distance. However, the meal is too simple, even comparing with my economy experience on the same route a few years ago.",experience is nice
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Cathay has a very good design on its seats on A350, it has enough space to put my things and the TV screen is huge. The food on board is fine, the service of the flight attendants is great. In conclusion, I love to fly with Cathay!",good design on its seats on A350
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Gold member on EK but decided to fly with Cathay from Singapore to Vancouver via Hong Kong and back. Influenced by the pricing strategy of the airline which is to entice passengers from countries in the Far East to travel to YVR with Cathay. Very much regret the choice. Noted a big deficiency in the airline’s punctuality and the casualness of ground staff. Not an airline to use if the connecting time is short. Outbound flight from SIN to HKG was delayed, meaning that the 2+ hours connecting time vanished. All connecting passengers (about 10 of us) had to literally sprint in HKIA to catch the YVR flight. On the inbound flight from YVR to HKG, an initial delay of 1 hour was announced. Despite the fact that connecting time in HKG was only 1 hour 15 minutes, the ground staff gave full assurance that the plane would make up for the lost time. Alas, with a delay of more than 2 hours to depart from YVR, the connecting flight HKG-SIN was missed. After a gruelling 12 hour flight from YVR plus the delay of 2 hours, I had to wait for another 5 hours in HKG to catch the next flight to SIN. As a souvenir, a meal voucher was offered!",regret the choice
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Flew Dubai-Hong Kong-Saigon. Started the travel from in transit in DXB 19-20 August 2019 on A330-300 and B777-300 aircrafts. Cathay uses the Lufthansa Lounge in DXB but it only opened 3 hours prior to departure and I had 12 hours in transit. Thus, I used BA’s lounge instead as I am Oneworld elite card holder. BA lounge is much better and lounge staff extremely polite and helpful. Flights on time. Service levels by FAs among the best in the skies. Food and drinks are deteriorating and has absolutely no business glamour: only 3 juices offered, only 2 cheap industrial beers (Carlsberg and San Miguel), no smoothies, no blue cheese. Seat Belt was on for hours without any turbulence – likely a cost saving measure and to allow FA to rest? But the passengers are left in the dark and there is no serving while the seat belt lamps are on. Bad experience. First flight provided a good dinner (3 options). I had seabass and later Japanese Noodle soup as mains. However, breakfast poor and only cold stuff served. Second flight was a morning flight: nice large Chinese Dim Sum breakfast served with lots of different, sophisticated dumplings. Lounges in HKG are very good and I was offered 5 options. IFE is good and clear. Priority boarding. Luggage handled perfectly. Mileage given quickly. Not cheap.",Food and drinks are deteriorating
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Madrid to Hong Kong. On my Palma to Madrid flight with Cathay Pacific, the code share partner Iberia refused to issue me my boarding pass for Madrid to Hong Kong when I checked in in Palma on August 11. I was told to get the boarding pass when I arrived in Madrid, this despite my plea that I had under 1.5 hours transit time. Things got worse when I arrived in Madrid. There was no Cathay Pacific counter in the transit hall, so I approached the Iberia counter to explain I needed my boarding pass to clear immigration in order to catch my flight to Hong Kong. The staff was adamant she could not meet my request as the two code share partners are on different systems. My only way to get the boarding pass was to get out of transit and check in at the Cathay counter. I kept pleading and finally the Iberia staff asked what time was my flight, and when I told her it was taking off in less than an hour, she took out a little notebook, found a number and called a Cathay Pacific line. The instruction from Cathay was to have her manually write down my name and flight number on a piece of paper, stamped with the Iberia company seal and present it to immigration. Her words to me were: I'm not sure if this works but you will have to try. Now run, there is no time. So I ran as fast as I could. At the immigration check, I was asked where is my boarding pass and all I could produce was the manually written pass. Thankfully, he accepted it, I ran for the shuttle train and made it Terminal 4S where passengers were already queuing to board the plane. I looked for a Cathay Pacific staff in charge of the boarding procedures and explained to her I need my boarding pass. Thankfully, she understood what I had just went through and quickly had my boarding pass printed. Even the Cathay Pacific staff in Hong Kong airport transit found it incredulous and urged me to ask the airline for an explanation so that it can rectify the issue before other passengers get caught out. I'm not sure if others have experienced similar with a code share partner refusing to issue a boarding pass because the airlines are on different systems. This is a back end matter that should have been settled before tickets are sold. Passengers like myself have paid for the ticket and do not expect to be denied boarding pass because of unresolved back end issues.",no Cathay Pacific counter
Cathay Pacific Airways,"I travel between HKG and SIN on Cathay Pacific quite often. This is my first time choosing CX650, an early morning flight. The aircraft (A330, 18 years in service) is too old comparing with other flights on the same route. The food is okay but they no longer serve the Haagen Dazs in economy class (as they did a few years ago). I will still fly with Cathay Pacific but I won't choose this flight again unless a different type of aircraft is used.",aircraft is too old

Anyway, we landed in Hong Kong safely and punctually.","friendly, polite and helpful"
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Vancouver to Singapore via Hong Kong. My first experience flying Cathay. Vancouver to Hong Kong leg was a 777-300ER both ways. It's a magnificent airplane and their business class layout makes it better. Cathay lounges at Vancouver, Hong Kong and Singapore were very nice, clean and well decorated. The lounge food options are a bit subpar in all three locations, though. The in-flight service, as well as food, was great. HKG-YVR had amazing Australian beef steak served. Their signature burger is also very tasty. The FAs were attentive, and answered requests promptly. On the YVR-HKG leg, I slept for 7 hours, when I woke up, an FA came by to ask if I needed anything. The only bad sides were a poor selection of movies and tv shows (only 4 episodes of Family Guy for example) and lack of Wifi on their planes, which I found very strange. Great experience overall and will consider Cathay again.",will consider Cathay again
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Gatwick to Hong Kong. Im a CX gold card and lounge access at BA given. Boarding fast, lovely welcome, seat in PE great, loads of space. Food really tasty, snacks, noodles delivered quickly. Captain informative and after slight delay, we arrived on time. Crew are good, a lot is expected of them and they deliver. Big negative is new 'print off your ticket and bag tags' procedure. Its not that clear how.",Food really tasty
Cathay Pacific Airways,"My husband and I flew from London to Hong Kong using Cathay Pacific We were most disappointed in the Premium Economy seats. Our seating was at the back of the section actually in the economy cabin with a curtain drawn only after dark between us and the front row of Economy by using an angled curtain. The flight was uncomfortable because the leg rest would not fold back under the seat properly and the footplate which is minimal spun around so it was difficult to keep the feet on straight footplates. Staff did their work pleasantly but were not in evidence after the meal was served. One had to locate a remote control for being able to call a staff member and the remote control was not immediately evident being by one's thigh so it proved difficult or impossible to get staff attention without this knowledge. As a concession to Premium Economy, a fancy printed menu was received for the meal but when the meal arrived not only were they out of most options but the grey sludge which appeared as the remaining fish dish was most unappetising. As I was next to the economy passengers there appeared no difference between the meals in each cabin although I think there must have been some slight difference. Premium Economy is that only in name in Cathay Pacific. There was minimal extra room between seats and it was very difficult for the person on the window to climb over the person on the aisle to go to the toilet. We had also done the Hong Kong London sector going and the comments are the same. Premium Economy is Economy with a new name - I would not waste my money again.",most disappointed in Premium Economy
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Adelaide to Bangkok via Hong Kong. Both flights on time, with the good service. Seats were comfortable and food was decent. IFE had a great choice with decent size touch screen. As a One World Platinum member, the lovely Purser made sure that I was comfortable all the time.",Seats were comfortable
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Dubai to Manila via Hong Kong. I have always been a fan and loyal customer of Cathay Pacific and been happy with the level of service and product. However, earlier this year, I flew with Singapore Airlines, economy, and there I experienced a superior economy class service and product. From IFE panel and content, cabin crew service and food. To mention, They offered hot towel and simple amenity kit, in their economy class. This recent experience with CX, DXB-MNL via HKG was somewhat confusing. I am going to blame it due to being a full flight, and service will be affected. Just to note some, male cabin crew told a female passenger who asked for assistance with her luggage storage when there was no space “why you came late?”. Another female cabin crew, while I was watching, suddenly called my attention and I thought she was offering me hot drinks. I replied “coffee” and she clarified if I was the one who asked for tea earlier. When I said no, she moved on, i am not sure if she apologized for it and at least should have offered if I wanted coffee. There was also a minor glitch with IFE for few minutes. The saving grace, the CX935 HKG-MNL leg. Crew were all friendly, captain  very jolly and inflight service manager sound very friendly on announcement. A350-900 felt new, cool seat design, IFE panel and interior were amazing. DXB airport ground crew were all friendly, polite and helpful. HKG airport is a joy to stay for layover.",experience was somewhat confusing
Cathay Pacific Airways,Barcelona to Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific Airways. This flight did not live up to expectations promised by the 'Go Beyond' advertising. Boarding was efficiently managed although the flight departed nearly an hour late. As a regular long haul traveler I look forward to the airline food and normally choose the Asian option as I have done very well on other carriers based in Asia. However it was very disappointing so I assume the budget had been cut to the minimum. Cabin crew were polite but often not around much between meal times. The A350 has good sized screens for entertainment however the choice was limited. I will probably look at other flight options next time.,flight did not live up to expectations
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Hong Kong to Copenhagen in 2018. The seat is quite comfortable. The space isn't too narrow and the headrest is soft and  comfortable. The personal television is large and there is many movies, TV, music and games provided.

It is quite delicious.",seat is quite comfortable
Cathay Pacific Airways,Gatwick to Melbourne via Hong Kong. Have travelled on Cathay every two years or so on this route in business class. Surprised and disappointed to be told on boarding at Gatwick that pyjamas are no longer supplied in what is clearly a long haul overnight flight. A stupid cost cutting measure that trashes Cathay's business product. Excellent service and food diminished greatly by this decision. Amusing to see fellow canny passengers sitting up in their Qantas PJs for the flight - not a good look Cathay! I have contacted 'customer relations' on this matter and received the usual PR blah blah response. Such a shame and a ridiculous decision.,pyjamas are no longer supplied
Cathay Pacific Airways,"London to Hong Kong. I was able to get a last minute ticket to Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific Airways and it was very good price. The pro is 4-5 flights a day from Heathrow to Hong Kong and onward to many Asian cities. Service and product is consistent. However for a premium economy passenger (I often fly their business class and find it underwhelming) I think other Asian airlines do a much better job. The seat is comfortable but very dated. On my return journey the economy class cabin had received a make over - with more seats squeezed in but also new IFE installed. Premium economy meanwhile still had the old IFE and old deco. I also found Cathay Pacific entertainment very limited. Catering onboard was not good. I always eat in the lounge when I fly with CX and skip meals onboard. Even their business class meal is not up to standard let along Premium Economy offerings. I also found service deteriorating. Most of the crew were robotic and just about to manage their tasks. Also depends on your luck. On some of the 777 premium economy you have to go to economy class to use the toilets. And when you reach there the toilets are not clean. Overall if you want a good flying time then CX is good, otherwise if you are looking for a good travel experience go with SQ, BR and CI.",I found service deteriorating
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Dubai to Hong Kong. Want to be robbed in business class? Then let me recommend Cathay Pacific. Apparently this happens enough that showing people kindness and compassion does not matter to crew members as demonstrated to me when my purse was stolen from the business class bin where the flight attendant put it and found in the economy toilet during my night flight from Dubai to Hong Kong. After I exited the plane and the police conducted the investigation that did not recover the lost items, no crew member offered their apologies or help. Not one offered to help me find the lounge or my connecting flight. No one asked me where I was going or if I needed anything. In tears I asked security personnel for help. She asked a Cathay employee to take me to the lounge. The employee looked less than thrilled and put upon. She walked several strides ahead of me as I struggled to keep up. I'd trade a fancy lounge for safety, kindness and an apology any day.",robbed in business class?
Cathay Pacific Airways,"My first experience on Cathay Pacific was horrific. I waited in line for 2 hours at JFK to board flight 841 to Hong Kong (with a connection to Koh Samui) that was scheduled to leave at 10am on Wednesday June 26th while the gate attendant kept saying there was a minor technical delay and we would be boarding in a few minutes. After two hours the desk attendant said while the flight was not cancelled we had to all leave the gate immediately and pick up our luggage. I called to reschedule my flight but was told I could not do so because I was already checked in for fight 841 and had to go to the service desk. After waiting another hour for my luggage I went to the business class service window where I had a three hour wait to be helped. There was pandemonium at the window with hordes of people crowding the counter and the agents ignoring the lines. After waiting for hours and finally getting an agent to help me I was told that I was already rebooked on flight 845 which was leaving at 1am the following morning. I had not received an email or text about this and it appears I waited in line for hours for no reason. When I showed up for flight 845 at 10pm that night after losing a day of my life waiting at JFK I was told it was overbooked and they did not have a seat for me. I was trying to connect to a flight to Koh Samui where I had reservations at a resort. In the end I was booked on a flight that went to Vancouver and then on to Hong Kong which added five hours to my flying time. I missed an entire day at the resort where I was headed. And the worse of it all is that there was no communication from the airline.I paid $10,000 for this business class ticket and spent the money hoping that by going business class I would not be subjected to so much stress. I am a frequent flyer on Delta and American Airlines and although they have their problems I have never experienced anything like this before in terms of the lack of communication, misinformation, pandemonium at the check-in desk, customer service that said it could not help me because I was checked into a flight that never took off, being rebooked onto a flight that had no capacity and lack of any apparent management oversight. In the end the airline has offered my a $250 voucher toward a future flight which feels inadequate. I am really disappointed in an airline that I though was among the best in the world.",My experience  was horrific
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Hong Kong to Cairns. Very poor premium economy service. This was the worst inflight service I've ever experienced. Took two hours for food to arrive on a relatively short 6.5 hour overnight flight. When it did arrive it was abysmal. Very small portion, bland, and overly salty tomato sauce on dried pasta. Not even three course meal. Crew very inefficient, passengers still had meal trays waiting collection three hours after take out. Then we were woken up again two hours later for breakfast which was a dry pastry in a box. This was my third trip on Cathay on this same route, and their inflight service has been very poor indeed each time. They are not cheap, and I would not want to fly again with them. Their seats are very comfortable but the rest falls far behind their competitors.",was the worst inflight service
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Johannesburg to Hong Kong, Boeing 777-300 ER. It was my first international flight to Asia especially, Hong Kong. The cabin crew was the friendliest and the service on board was amazing. Fortunately for me, I had no other passengers seated next to me and it was so comfortable and relaxing throughout my longest flight ever. The only down factor was that it was very cold throughout the night. My feet were very cold because of the air conditioner and of course flying over oceans too. I loved the fact that the flight attendant handed passengers disembarking from the airline for Hong Kong special visitor slips. I think it was really handy and going through immigration went quite fast. Thank you to Cathay Pacific flight CX 749 back to OR Tambo International Aiport from Hong Kong on the 16th June for giving me a last-minute seat onboard this flight because I missed my actual flight on the 15th June 2019 back to South Africa. Cathay Pacific flight CX 749 was really comfortable and much warmer on board and the service was good but can be improved. I will definitely fly again with Cathay Pacific in the future.",the service on board was amazing
Cathay Pacific Airways,"This is an interesting 5th freedom flight operated by Cathay Pacific, with the aircraft continuing onto Hong Kong from Bangkok. My first time flying an A350 and I was amazed by the spaciousness of the cabin. Leg room was comfortably sufficient for economy class and the load factor was relatively low so I had the row to myself which is a plus point. Food was above average and quite a spread - Main course, fruits, bread, water, drinks, ice cream. Cabin crew were largely courteous and smiley, except for one who kept a poker face for most of the time. Departed and landed on time.",amazed by the spaciousness of the cabin
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Sydney to Dubai via Hong Kong. At my Sydney bag drop, I was fortunate to be advised at check-in by the most engaging, informative supervisor. Time was taken to explain my seating. advice re: my HK layover etc. Her kindness was appreciated. Sadly that was the end of any memorable Cathay experience. It was a full flight on an ancient aircraft which might have been doable except for the inconsistency with the cabin crew. I found any interaction with some was most unpleasant. Others were helpful but few. After seeing the menu I was waiting for refreshments to arrive. I watched the trolley loaded in the galley and was totally ignored. I was surprised and with the attitude of the female crew member in my area hesitant to ask. As this woman was abrupt, dismissive, actually bordering on rude. Therefore I left the flight certainly looking for some refreshment. These flights are not budget and the disdain I experienced was awful. The HK to Dubai was better as it was a night flight but breakfast was very ordinary. After my return home, this will be my last Cathay flight. I dread if anything goes wrong based on their attitude when all was on schedule.",will be my last Cathay flight
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Boston to Jakarta via Hong Kong. A missed connection on American Airlines bumped me to Cathay Pacific. The 15 hour flight to Hong Kong was ok. The food was average, the flight staff were nice. My problem came when they refused to even considering to allow me to fly standby on a flight that was 9 hours earlier because locating my baggage with a 5 hour window was going to be too much trouble. I even offered to retrieve the bags the next day since 1 of them appeared to be left in Boston anyway. The customer service was terrible and they just keep reminding me it was American Airlines that caused me to miss the original flight not them so they were not obligated to help me. C.H. an unfriendly girl at the service desk was particularly indifferent and unapologetic. She suggested that she couldn’t help me because she didn’t know how much I paid for my original ticket. I was 38 hours into this nightmare and she had no problem adding another 10 hours to my trip because I originally booked with a partner airline. Whatever this One World partnership is they should boot Cathay out of their system for terrible customer service.",terrible customer service
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Travelled Ho Chi Minh City to Dubai via Hong Kong on 29 June 2019 on B777-300 and B330-300 respectively. Smooth check-in with 3 business class counters open. My luggage got checked in to the next 4 legs (including on another ticket with Kenya Airways). Nice. Priority lane for security and lounge in Le Saigonnais (was given 2 choices) were fine. First flight delayed from SGN. An early announced 1 hour delay ended up to be 2 hours made me miss my HKG-connection by 2 hours. That caused me to miss my connection in HKG where staff waited for me tried to rebook and examined a lot of option. Next CX flight to DXB kicked off only 10 hours later and made me lose my onward tickets (2 legs). A lot of courtesy, assistance, and sympathy was received in HKG due to the delay but the results and outcome eventually became nil as they regretted early promised options of sending me onwards via Jo-burg or with Emirates to Dubai. Suffered many hours in desperation trying to sort out my further connections from their Bridge Lounge. First flight world  class cuisine and caring. Business class full.  Second flight so, so – dinner hardly edible. Both flights: FAs are active, caring, and truly professional. Beer choices are a disaster and limited to mass produced industrial stuff (Heineken, Carlsberg, Foster, and San Miguel). No WiFi; good IFE. Clean aircraft. Good lounges in HKG. Delay unacceptable and delay handling unsatisfactory: was denied to see the manager as the staff would not allow. They pay lipservice, a lot of lipservice, but significant results, actions, or willingness to pay for any additional routing are not to be seen. They let down passengers by eventually being stingy: nothing must cost them anything additional. Not a true business class experience. The airline falls behind what I expected. Wonder how they treat economy class passengers during irregularities? I can mention 10 airlines that supersede CX with a better biz-class product. It seems at least that they had a bad day.",falls behind what I expected2
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Hong Kong to London. Ground service was smooth and efficient. Though the gate was a bit far away from the immigration, the check in counter was very quick. The seat was modern and they provided a wide range of movies and TV shows in the IFE system. Two meals were served and snacks including cup noodles were served in between. Desserts were also served in the economy class. I could get my check in luggage swiftly and reached central London in an hour.",smooth and efficient
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Cathay arbitrarily cancelled my daughter's return ticket, leaving her stranded in Philippines. We had no other option than to purchase a fare at full price the day of the flight. This is how they operate. When they have you at a disadvantage figure on getting screwed. Never again Cathay.",Never again Cathay
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Hong Kong to Taipei. Cathay has lost its shine. I transferred over $40,000 Asian miles into my account for this trip without knowing that it will take a week to arrive my account. Offered to pay cash for HK lounge Access, which was what listed on its Marco Polo section of the website, pay US$75 at the counter to enjoy the lounge. I was denied access and been sent away to pay to use the airport paid lounge. Flight delayed more than 2 hrs and counting. Would steer away from Cathay at all costs.",Cathay has lost its shine
Cathay Pacific Airways,"London to Hong Kong. I have been flying this long haul route for some years, and often with Cathay, in fact this sector recently as well. I’ve never posted a review and never had cause for complaint before now. But something has recently gone very wrong with this previous exceptional airline. On boarding, even though I was on early, I wasn’t offered a drink and the staff seemed manically busy. But that’s not a biggie. After takeoff, the usual polite approach about meal choices - and this is where it all went wrong. The choices where limited (OK, it happens) and pretty dreadful. The ‘express’ option was either a vegetarian salad (OK, I’ll live with that as well) or soup (soup??). That’s it. So now I’m pressed for what I’m going to have for brunch (brunch? Where did brunch come from? Wasn’t mentioned on the last three same sectors I’ve done). I can’t describe the options as other than the omelette the words were unknown to me - I investigated further and found one that was fried turnips with some sort of porridge on top. No thanks, so I gave up. By the way, later on I was told that first class had cereals and croissants and toast - are you kidding me? So back to ‘dinner’. The vegetarian choice was a warm salad which sounded ok - and by the way, still haven’t been offered a drink which would have been nice. The ‘meal’ arrived with half a glass of red wine (which was good - disappeared quickly though), and wait for it. It was a sort of salad although you couldn’t see it as it as an orange foul smelling hot sauce had been poured on it. Disgusting. I politely handed it back, gave up and asked for the cheese. That appeared a little later - three water crackers, three grapes and two tiny wedges of cheese. Two and a half hours now passed - asked for a top up of wine. It never came, so I gave up, put my tray on the floor, drank some water and went to sleep. Six hours later, tried to get a tea, told the seat belt light was on and they couldn’t. Ok, I get that, but believe me, there was zero turbulence that anyone could possibly feel and the crew had disappeared. Got my fried turnips (sans porridge) and water at “brunch”, then when the bumps increased, off came the seat belt sign and I got a cup of tea and the chief of cabin crew got me a small croissant from first class! No, I’m not a whinger, yes, I understand safety and I know an airline when it’s losing the plot - sorry Cathay but I worked with you some years ago, have flown this route countless times, but we have choices now, and that was a shocker. What ever genius found your ‘chef’ and threw away the up and down the aisle service (forget the ipads - they take ages for the crew to work them out), get rid of him or her and go back to what you were doing less than 12 months ago - it worked.",something has recently gone very wrong
Cathay Pacific Airways,"London to Manila via Hong Kong. I landed in Manila on the evening of 13 June but my luggage did not arrive with me. While I understand that missing or delayed luggage is not uncommon, you have to note that there were about 4 or 5 other people complaining that their luggage did not arrive with them. All of these people flew Cathay Pacific! That tells you something about their baggage handling. When I posted about my experience I have friends who reached out to me that they too experienced the same same thing, one even shared it happened some two years ago and where they lost 2 luggage which was never recovered and it took them months before they got compensated for the hassle! My experience with them about my missing luggage tells me that they are notoriously terrible at handling their customers' luggage! Never flying with them again ever and I would never recommend this airline to anyone!",my luggage did not arrive with me
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Singapore to Hong Kong. Excellent Economy Class seats, however, older A330-300s may have smaller and lower quality IFE screens. Cabin was clean in general, and food was substantial. Crew were great and provided excellent service.",provided excellent service
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Hong Kong to Madrid. Excellent from Check in to Baggage collection. Food was very good, great sleep, loads of movies, crew were professional and very accommodating to random requests. l prefer the A350-900 over the Boeing 787, toilet is bigger and a decent size hand basin.",crew were professional
Cathay Pacific Airways,"San Francisco to Kuala Lumpur via Hong Kong. Food was below expectations, stewardesses spent their time chit chatting when the lights were dimmed (hardly any offer of water to customers during flight). MJy headset jack was spoilt and they could not do anything about it so I was watching silent movie for many hours during my 13.5 hours flight.",spent their time chit chatting
Cathay Pacific Airways,Washington to Hong Kong. I had such a good experience with Cathay. This was a 16 hour direct flight and I was not particularly excited for the length of this one but it wound up being perfect. The flight staff were incredibly attentive. The middle section of the plane had great headroom. The flight was smooth and the pilot was great. The in-flight entertainment was  great.,such a good experience
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Purchased ticket as early bird fare at a great price and was best decision made. From the moment you enter the cabin after a visit to the Qantas business class lounge at Sydney Airport (One World partner) it is a very comfortable and enjoyable experience. An A330 from Sydney - Hong Kong, the plane was a little dated but still fine however the A350 flight from Hong Kong to Amsterdam was a near new plane, very sleek and modern.Welcome drink and warm towels are handed to you prior to departure and meals are served not long after take off. Great choice from the menu including a Wagyu burger they make from the galley - very delicious. Seats are shaped like a pod so there is plenty of personal space to stretch legs and relax (pod stretches out to form a comfortable bed to sleep in). IFE is fine, with a good choice of movies, music, games etc. Staff are attentive and keep an eye on any requirements during the flight. Spent some time in The Pier Business Lounge at HKIA in transit to Amsterdam and has showers, yoga room, bar, dumpling house and tea house. A great way to unwind for a connecting flight at HKIA.",a very comfortable and enjoyable experience
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Seattle to Hong Kong. I was pretty excited to fly premium economy on the A350. The seat was not as amazing as I was expecting. Great design and storage, not as comfortable as the extra cushioned Boeing 777-300 PE seats. As always, food was very boring. It's almost always the same. Same starter, same main and same ice cream. Extreme consistency means lack of excitement. And, of course, same breakfast as always. The presentation of the food as always very sterile and basic, making the food taste even worse. Flight attendants robotic but still helpful. Overall not at the level of most of the other premium economy experiences I had with other airlines. Not worth the price.",Not worth the price
Cathay Pacific Airways,Auckland to Dublin via Hong Kong. I found Cathay Pacific terrible. 6 of us travelled in cramped seats and the food was terrible. We didn’t get what we wanted because they ran out. One dinner I handed back because it was disgusting. There was no offer of anything else. I had heard great reviews but don’t think I will fly them again. As a family of 6 adults this has cost us a lot of money and it was the worst trip I’ve ever experienced. Unfortunately we have to on the way home on Thursday. I think we should be upgraded as this was the worst travel I have ever had. I have told others about our trip and they don’t want to fly Cathay now either. Disgusted family of 6.,the food was terrible
Cathay Pacific Airways,"I used to fly Cathay Pacific Business between Europe and Asia (and was disappointed with the service) but had to fly Premium Economy this time due to the high price during holiday season. Overall I think it represents better value than business class. Check in at London Heathrow was fully automatic - you have to print out the boarding pass, luggage tag and attached it to your bag and drop it using a machine. Not an issue here. Boarding was smooth and easy and we took off on time. Hot towel and welcome drink were provided. I was able to secure the first row of the cabin and found the leg room much better than other seats in PE. However the screen is stored below the arm rest so if you plan to watch a lot of movie or have gate to gate entertainment this is the row to avoid. The A350 used for Hong Kong to Taipei sector is far superior than the B777 for long haul. I found the food and service ok - given the fact that it was sub standard in business class. One thing I don't appreciate is unlike EVA which I often fly with, the toilets were not regularly cleaned. I also found the selection of movies poor. When I booked my Premium Economy ticket I was inform that the flight from Hong Kong to Taipei would be operated by A330 without PE so I was allocated a seat in economy. When I arrived at the gate I spotted that it was changed to A350 with PE and check with the ground staff if it is possible to get a seat in PE. I was told that the airplane was still an A330 and there was no PE available - that proved to be totally wrong.",found the food and service ok
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Sydney to Hong Kong. It is sad to see Cathay Pacific fall from grace. I have flown them for many years however today was my first flight with them for over 3 years. What a shock. From the old tired plane, no warm towels, no welcome drink, no snacks, absent staff and incredibly poor meals it was all downhill. The biggest shock was the poor service. I used to recommend Cathay Pacific, no more. Very sad",it was all downhill
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Toronto to Hong Kong. This was an agonizing trip. I’m about 5'5 tall and my knees touched the seat back in front of me. When the person in that seat reclined he was literally in my lap. It was a long trip, more than 15 hours, but cabin crew discouraged people from standing and stretching legs. And though we left after 1am, the cabin was kept dark almost the entire trip. The food was okay but the entertainment system had some really good movies. What was surprising was that we changed planes in Hong Kong and flew Cathay Dragon into Beijing and that plane was so comfortable with plenty of legroom. That was only a flight of 3 plus hours.",an agonizing trip
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Madrid to Tokyo  via Hong Kong. Friendly staff, seat on the A350 is great to lounge/eat and even sleep. On 777 bit less so and more chaotic and economy class meal. A350 to Hong Kong premium meal which was nothing to complain about. Enough snacks and drinks during the flight. PE well worth the money.",well worth the money
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Melbourne to Tokyo via Hong Kong. Every time I've flown with Cathay it hasn't been great but this flight proved to be nightmarish. Landed in Narita via Hong Kong only to find my luggage had been lost! Although it was recovered in a few days time, the inconvenience caused by this cannot be understated. I was not offered any form of compensation beyond a simple apology. On the way back, there was also a 90-minute delay applied to the (midnight) HKG layover, during which they were asking if guests were willing to take a flight the next day as the replacement plane could not fit all passengers. Furthermore, the reason for this delay was never explained by the ground crew! Cabin staff overall was average bordering on robotic save for one exceptional hostess, I still gave it a 2 as on the return leg, menus for dinner/breakfast was not distributed and incoming passenger cards were only provided upon request (!) Speaking of which, meals were nothing special either compared to JAL, Emirates or even Delta. The only positives I can think of is the above average legroom and the relatively up-to-date inflight entertainment, including full seasons of many TV shows.",flight proved to be nightmarish
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Hong Kong to Milan. I had high expectations and most of them were disattended. The aircraft was extremely noisy, even with headphones the noise was really strong. The choice of movie is not so great. The seats are comfortable when you are seated but not when you lay flat. There is no extra mattress or something that soften a little the hard seat. Food is sufficient but nothing special. Flight attendants were nice",There is no extra mattress
Cathay Pacific Airways,Hong Kong to Manila.  This was a horrible experience flying with Cathay and a horrible customer service experience compared with any other airline I’ve ever flown internationally. Flight was delayed resulting in me missing my connection. Airline refused to rebook the next leg of my flight or pay for a hotel even though rebooking caused me to have to overnight a place I had not anticipated. Underwhelmed by the service during this event and the quality of the airline all around.,a horrible experience
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Hong Kong to Brisbane via Cairns. Worst business class experienced. Definitely not worth the money. Hong Kong Business lounge is alright and the catering staff is generally friendly and helpful. Grumpy, cold and slack crew. Knowing I had injured my shoulder, the crew didn't bother to help me with my cabin baggage in any capacity even when they saw me struggle. In-flight meal was awful. Cold, thick-skinned dim sum. The braised salmon was cold in the centre as well. I left almost everything uneaten, but the crew didn't bother to care or ask why. Cathay's cost cutting measures are really hurting its core product. I'd take my business to Singapore Airlines in a heartbeat, which even provides free cabin WiFi.",Worst business class
EVA Air,"During boarding i noticed a negative atmosphere. During dinner everything was cleared away without asking, we noticed that the staff on board were rushing the whole time. Seat malfunction, screen did not work as it should, asking for a new seat they told me its not possible. The food was ok, inflight entertainment is very limited. Ground staff were ok, very efficient boarding in Bangkok.",“a negative atmosphere”
EVA Air,The food was excellent. The flight left on time. The toilets were clean. The staff were attentive. The seat was very small and legroom was tight. The entertainment system was poor.,The staff were attentive
EVA Air,"I bought 4 EVA roundtrip economy class tickets between NRT and LAX via TPE, this was the first time I seated myself on an EVA’s economy class seat. All in all, I consider their in-flight services on par with those of other 5-Star Airlines. Recommended. On our return flight, however, an unexpected matter occurred at the time of check-in at LAX. Prior to leaving for LAX, as all family members have an ANA frequent flyer program account, I set each flight to be credited there. As my wife and I have Star Alliance Gold status given by United Airlines, through the priority lane, we checked in 4 pieces of our luggage, showing a representative our Star Alliance Gold status on the cellular phone screen. However, she didn’t intend to attach a priority tag to each piece. “Please remember we have Star Alliance Gold status,” I retorted. She said to me, “You are not qualified for the priority tags being attached to your luggage, because your flight miles are credited to ANA.” I answered flatly, “Accrual is accrual. Privilege is privilege. OK? Accrual is one thing. Privilege is another.” She didn’t seem to understand how each Star Alliance member’s frequent flyer program worked. Finally, another female representative replaced her and had the priority tug attached to each piece. But she changed our accounts to be credited, from ANA to UA without our consent. It was not until we passed the immigration that I was aware of it.",on par with other 5-Star Airlines
EVA Air,"It is my perhaps 12th time flying with EVA business but it was the first long haul on Boeing 787 instead of the usual Boeing 777. It was a great flight. Boeing 787 cabin feels more private and modern, and the entertainment system is a big upgrade from the B777. EVA is still probably one of the best business class out there but the standard has slipped during the past few years. The food is served in a ceromonic way but the food quality has declined. Salad came with too much vinegar, and the main course was bland (the FA mistakenly gave my pre-ordered main course to another passenger). It was also quite rush, not the usual elegant EVA style. I have noticed that they are no longer serving VC vintage champagne - although the new replacement is still better than other airlines' business class champagne. A lot of small touches are missing which is a shame. The other shortfall is wifi - you have to apply before your flight to get 50 MB free data allowance. Service overall is efficient and friendly enough, but lack in warmth and enthusiastic. The lounge in Taipei. It is very dated, no natural light, and the food/drink selection is very poor. No sparkling wine/champagne, food quality has declined and they have also stopped serving cold pressed juice. The shower room was dated and wasn't cleaned properly. It's a place that I don't want to stay for more than 20 minutes.",It was a great flight
EVA Air,On my flight to Cebu I was covered in bug bites by the end of my flight. On my return flight we were the first ones to check in and the the attendant put my husbands name in twice and erased mine. So we had to wait for 2 1/2 with a child stuck in the check in area. Then they finally fixed it without help we were separated on the flight home and they wouldn’t upgrade one of us.,they wouldn’t upgrade one of us
EVA Air,"Another great set of flights R/T Bangkok to San Francisco via Taipei. The EVA service from start to finish was 5 Star, check-in, boarding, inflight service, baggage handling, etc. The lounges in Bangkok and Taipei are great. I pre-ordered my main meal on my long haul flight segments, the Rack of Lamb was as good as any fine restaurant! The flight attendants provided an exceptional high level of service, attending to every need with a smile. The comfort level in business is over the top. I was in an individual side pod which was roomy, lots of storage space, a large entertainment monitor and a comfortable lie flat bed which was made up with a mattress cover and plush duvet for sleeping. I was even given a size to order set of pyjamas. By far, EVA is my airline of choice for Asia to the USA flights,",service from start to finish was 5 Star
EVA Air,"I flew Eva Air at Christmas and it wasn’t the greatest experience but not the worst. This time the flight was one of the easiest long hauls I have ever done. It was very pleasant, food was ok. I was assigned a middle and I am extremely claustrophobic so with the help off the ground staff they were able to move me to an aisle.",It was very pleasant
EVA Air,"I have been a loyal EVA customer for many years. I have earned their Gold Status (Infinity MileageLands). I needed to redeem my frequent flier points before the end of June. Thankfully they had extended the expiration date a few times because of COVID19. I decided to redeem the points and fly from Chiang Mai to Vancouver. After being frustrated with doing the online booking myself, the Taipei office (loyalty) kindly phoned me and walked me through the process and everything was perfect. Once in Vancouver I decided to make a trip over to Toronto and I needed to extend my EVA ticket. This time the Taipei and the Chiang Mai office worked together to make that possible for me. I am very grateful to the Taipei office along with Zee and his Chiang Mai office colleagues. Again, the onboard service offered by EVA just doesn't get any better. There are little things that make a difference. At the door, they check your name on the boarding pass and then greet you by name. Each time they speak to you afterwards they refer to you by name. The FA takes you to your seat. When they speak to you, they do not bend down but rather get down to your level and speak to you. When you use the lavatory, on the way out they ask you if there is anything that you need. This is really impeccable service. The food is wonderful along with the wines and cocktails. This excellent service is not a one-off for me but rather what I have experienced before in business class from EVA. When I have had difficulty in the past, I have found that the loyalty department at Taipei is most helpful and I can say that same about the Chiang Mai office. I did note that I was not eligible for the free WiFi since I was on an award ticket. That is unfortunate because one receives the points to use an award from being a frequent flier. Again, my appreciate to the Taipei loyalty office and Zee and the Chiang Mai staff.",This is really impeccable service
EVA Air,"BR211 TPE-BKK on 04/28, third leg of SE Asia trip with Hubby. EVA uses a 77W for this trip, the same metal we were on just a few hours ago from LAX. Boarding was done by group and they announced the group names clearly and where we can line up so it was quite organized. The flight attendants were again very polite and helpful but efficient in helping people with their luggage and seating. Service was very good, quick and friendly done by cheerful cabin crew. The captain made announcements at the beginning of the trip and information on Bangkok airport condition just before our descent. We landed just slightly ahead of plan. It was a very good trip.",It was a very good trip
EVA Air,"Flew EVA on BR11 LAX-TPE on 04/27 just after midnight. Boarding was done by zone but there were no clear information on where to line up for each zone and which zone is currently boarding so it was quite chaotic. Unless I asked to the gate agent about our transfer from a United flight, we won't know that our United-generated boarding passes have to be exchanged with EVA ones to be able to use the automated gate and our baggage tags needs to be stamped. In LAX they used the new automated gates that makes the boarding process quite slow since many people don't know how to properly scan their boarding passes. Once on board, the flight attendants were very efficient in how to help passengers with their luggage and finding their seats. They were very polite but still ensure that all safety precautions are followed. Once we were airborne and the service started, the FAs were very courteous and helpful, and give a very good service. They informed us of the two meals we will be served on board and the timing of the second meal (two hours prior to land) and there are snacks available in between. Service started with a welcome drink (water, orange juice, wine or beer) then dinner. Once dinner was served and cleaned, they dimmed out the cabin lights so passengers can sleep. Throughout the evening flight the FAs made frequent rounds with water or OJ. The restrooms were kept clean and there were ample amenities there (toothbrush, toothpaste, lotion, etc.) at all times. The orchid decoration on the restroom wall is a very nice touch. Inflight entertainment is quite good but the layout is quite confusing. I didn't know they have many more options until the last moments before we started our descent. The lights came back on just before second meal (breakfast) is served, a very tasty Chinese congee. The captain made announcements regarding the planned trip before we leave, and about the current condition at Taipei airport before we start our descent. We land and got to our gate C5 ahead of time. Overall it was a very comfortable trip.",a very comfortable Trip
EVA Air,"First time I had flown Eva for about 7 years. The product was very good. The flight was roughly on time, which I thought was good as I was flying out in Christmas Eve. It was actually the fastest flight I’ve ever done at just over 10hours. Food was ok, movie selection has gone down hill.",product was very good
EVA Air,I was impressed with everything about my flight. Premium seat was spacious and comfortable and with the cabin half empty there was plenty of room to spread out. Meals were excellent quality for airline food. Got plenty of sleep. Very happy.,I was impressed with everything
EVA Air,"Not my first time using EVA Air but first time for about 5 years, check-in a bit slow as was security and passport control. Once airside used the EVA Air lounge through my FF status, the lounge is okay not great but quiet with okay food offering. Boarding was slow although polite, once on board arrived at my seat 26A which I always like on this aircraft. Drinks served before departure which was around an hour late, once in the air the crew provided a good service. The seat was pretty comfortable and luckily I had the adjacent seat empty, lunch and dinner served during the flight with drinks and snacks offered frequently. I'm a big fan of Premium Economy and EVA Air do it well, more PTV options might be nice however I slept 6 hours so okay. Arrived on time after 12 hours 20 minutes bags off quickly great service, I did notice though that EVA Air have installed 3-4-3 in economy so I wont be flying economy on EVA but otherwise would use EVA anytime in PE.",crew provided a good service
EVA Air,"My experience on the London Bangkok route was pretty mediocre. But let's start with the good : the staff are fantastic, well-trained, polite, efficient and gracious. The EVA web site is so full go glitches that it is practically unusable if you have a problem needing solving. I wanted to retrieve my membership number and password, which proved impossible over three months of trying. When asked to enter my name it would reply Please enter an English name.  When I called customer service in Bangkok there was no reply ever. Cabin is nice, but small and cramped feeling, the herringbone arrangement is good but there is little privacy and the seats are narrow and not particularly comfortable. I am tall and have a disability so I'm not their ideal customer! There is no turn down service or mattress, so you have a blanket and have to put that down and sleep on top of it. The food was worse, though. As I recall, EVA always had great food and maybe Covid has impacted this. Bangkok-London offerings. Presentation is fine, we got a beef dish with a potato gratin that had a strange scent. My bead was microwaved plastic. The hostesses quietly apologized. Arriving at 6pm in London as it grew dark we were served breakfast. Congee, cereal and yoghurt and another weird omelette. There was a thing called Chicken with Red Cheese. This shows total lack of management. London to Bangkok was marginally better food wise. EVA doesn't have a lounge a Heathrow so they use the Lufthansa one. I need a wheelchair to get to gates they didn't send one. Boarding was an hour late, chaotic and disorganized. On board, the Chinese offering was good, fresh and real and the oolong tea is a lifesaver, but I didn't arrive feeling that I had enjoyed the flight. Tthe internet didn't work even though I paid for it.",experience was pretty mediocre
EVA Air,"Was extremely disappointed with this flight. Boarding in YYZ was a gong show. I had booked myself and my elderly parents into Premium Economy so we can board first and get the bags into the overhead storage and settle in. Instead, my parents who are seated next to me boarded in Zone 4. And I was in Zone 5. How does that make sense that we are boarding so late and also at different times? Furthermore, in Terminal 1, they haven't figured out how to coral people so you have people lining up arbitrarily somewhere and then some EVA air staff would walk around with a card saying some zone number and expects everyone to move over and join them. It was just pure chaos. I was hoping that the meals and service would be great but it was not.  They only served only 2 meals for the 15 hour flight. There wasn't an instant noodles snack. On top of that, my  meals weren't good. The flight attendants rarely walk by to ask if I wanted water which left me quite parched unless I buzzed them. Meagre catalogue of new movies. The shorter flight from Taipei to Kuala Lumpur had ever so slightly better movies. AC has better in-flight movies. Seat incline was very, very generous.  And because there was slightly more leg room, the person in front leaning completely back doesn't make moving around in your own seat, and even eating, a big issue. The flight arrived an hour late, thankfully I left a lot of time because my elderly parents were not mobile and I gave myself a few hours to transfer.",disappointed with this flight
EVA Air,"First the app of EVA Air is quite good. I am ANA member but could use with no problem and register my ANA card. You can check all in app and choose your menu in advance. The Japanese menu from Tokyo was quite good. Staff is really attentive. Food is great. Taipei to Paris Flight is older, still full flat bed, but food is good and staff is attentive. Maybe need more option between the 2 meal as it is a 15h flight. For both flight wine was great. I recommend this airline base on price and quality.",Staff is really attentive
EVA Air,The flight was pure torture with the thinly padded seats in the Boeing 787-10. Aisles were just large enough for the galley carts and since I was in an aisle seat if I was not careful I get bumped by flight attendants and fellow passengers. When my reservation was made I requested a wheelchair for my wife who can not walk a long distance. We had no issue in Seattle or Manila but at Taipei she was ignored in her request. So finding an unused wheelchair I wheeled my wife from the gate to the security checkpoint where an employee argued with me about stealing a wheelchair. EVA has lost me as a customer first the horrendous seats and the stolen wheelchair.,bumped by flight attendants
EVA Air,This was my third time to fly EVA Air with a long flight and 2 transfers. Having the first leg (DAL-SFO) with Alaska Airlines is great. It was comfortable and check in was smooth. The staff were very friendly. The actual EVA Air flights from SFO-TPE and TPE-CEB were also good. The staff were efficient and the flights were comfortable. I chose a low calorie meal which was great since you get veggies and fruits and protein! There was no selection which was fine but the first meal protein was dry. Most of the time it was chicken or egg whites. My last meal with chicken was delicious though! But this was my very first time that my bags did not arrive. My bags were yet to be located (as of this writing). The transfer from TPE-CEB was a little bit chaotic knowing that my previous flight (SFO-TPE) was delayed—which the airport crew handled well btw. The next leg was also moved. I was not worried since in my previous experiences—they always make sure that you get to your flight.,flights were comfortable
EVA Air,"It was a comfortable ride. The seats are not bad, you get what you pay for. Cabin crews are helpful. Food quality is alright, about the same as pre pandemic. Inflight entertainment is mediocre with a limited selections of movies and shows. Still it's worth flying with EVA Air if you are planning to fly Taiwan.",a comfortable ride
EVA Air,"Mid-November the outward journey AMS – BKK in the Boeing 787 dream liner, to my surprise, very little legroom, not to say, very tight, in row 21 , but I was lucky row 20, with a lot of legroom, (you looked at the pantry, among other things), 2 empty seats. Consultation with a flight attendant and I was very spacious on row 20B, stretching my legs, etc. The return flight BKK-AMS was a true torture for me and others, so little legroom, I was now in row 28C, soon here and there some irritation and sometimes a fight, especially if someone pushed their seat back a bit (by the way, a seat like C is not really nice, people constantly bump into you, including staff) The passenger in front of me moved his seat back a bit, so I monitor was about 10 cm away. So I leaned back a little, to which a passenger behind me started grumbling, I didn't want any problems, so I stood up and patiently explained to the man; don't complain to me but do it at EVA, or fly premium, ok that problem solved quickly. My thought, apparently due to the new seat configuration EVA still wanted to cash in? Half November de heenreis AMS – BKK in de Boeing 787 dream liner, tot mijn verbazing, zeer weinig beenruimte, om niet te zeggen, zeer krap, op rij 21, echter ik had geluk rij 20, met heel veel beenruimte, (je keek oa tegen de pantry aan), 2 lege stoelen. Ff overleggen met een stewardess en ik zat op 20B zeer ruim, benen strekken enz. De terugvlucht BKK-AMS was voor mij en anderen een ware marteling, zo weinig beenruimte, ik zat nu op rij 28C, al snel hier en daar wat irritatie en soms ruzie, met name als iemand zijn stoel wat naar achteren deed (by the way een stoel als C is ook niet echt lekker constant botsen mensen tegen je aan incl. personeel) De passagier voor mij deed zijn stoel wat naar achter, waardoor ik mijn monitor op ong.10 cm afstand kwam. Dus ik ook maar iets naar achter, waarop een passagier achter mij begon te mopperen, ik wilde geen problemen, dus ben gaan staan en de man geduldig uitgelegd; ga niet bij mij klagen maar doe dat bij EVA, of vlieg premium, ok dat probleem snel opgelost. Mijn gedachte, blijkbaar door de nieuwe stoelen configuratie wilde EVA nog ff cashen?",so little legroom
EVA Air,"The airplane is clean. Its facilities, such as the lighting and tray, function well. The service is good. Flight attendants are friendly and helpful. The seat is comfortable. The meal is delicious and fresh.",meal is delicious and fresh
EVA Air,"Starting from the boarding experience in Vienna, where they put you in a confined place for 30-40 minutes, with no seating. Some of the cabin crew serving me were lacking the basic communication and service skills. Infotainment system, was working properly, but a lot of the selection is for Asian passengers. Headphones provided to me were of a low quality, before. To exit your seat to the toilet, you need to climb out.",selection is for Asian passengers
EVA Air,"All flights were cancelled at Terminal 1, NAIA due to technical problems. All passengers of Eva Air BR278 were waiting in line For about an hour and there was no one at the check in counter to explain what we do next, and only a piece of paper showing contact numbers were given to us to rebook. My first time to fly Eva Air because my husband had very good things to say about the airline. The flight was to depart to Taipei at 1850 and I have a connecting flight to LAX at 2355. There was no one at the Check in counter and the Office was closed at 5pm. Text Message to my Phone about flight cancellation was received at 4:31pm and paper with contact information was passed around at around 4:45pm.",no one at the check in
EVA Air,"My wife and I, we are really outraged by the way we have been treated by the EVA AIR – BR75 team. The flight times have been moved up to 5 times, due to technical issues. Finally it was the next day. In the meantime we received 2 food vouchers, which could be used at a limited number of shops. The route from the gate to the shops was a long walk and then back. We are an elderly couple and not very mobile. By the time we got to a snack shop, there was already a queue of 50 people. Reason: many of those kind of shops were closed due to renovations. So we had to walk even further. At the end of the day we had to go to another gate; we had to wait again, without further information. Finally, we followed the whole group of people to the immigration gate, we had to hand over our passports. It is therefore forbidden according to the Dutch government to hand over your passport. Only if there is legal approval for this. A copy of our passports was not accepted. If we refuse, they wouldn't help us any further. So we had to do this. After a 30 minute bus ride we arrived at a hotel. Waiting endlessly again. We got a very basic room, no hot water, no luggage. We got a meal, went to bed exhausted at 11 pm, got up at 3 am, because we had to take the bus to the airport at 4 am. Waiting again, no one from EVA AIR was there to explain anything. 500 passengers, in small groups, were searching for information or help. The flight was not listed. And only around 07:30, the staff arrived and boarding could begin. We had to wait a long time for our passports, because a pile of numbered passports had been dropped. We are regular customers of EVA AIR, but we don't recognize the service anymore. This was so bad and customer unfriendly. This brings down the reputation of the company way down. We have submitted a complaint but unfortunately, have not received any response.",so bad and customer unfriendly
EVA Air,"On time departure and arrivals. Immaculate aircraft, warm attentive staff (ground and on board). Royal Laurel Class seating was very comfortable with excellent amenities. Great transit lounge service in TPE Airport. Catering was amazing and still preserving the first class experience serving individual courses one at a time and the pre flight expansive menu is awesome. EVA is always our #1 choice for travel.",always our #1 choice for travel

EVA Air,"Narrow seat. EVA Air has 10 seats per row in Economy class, even 9 seats per row in same aircraft of Thai Airways. Flight delayed and some baggage left at airport. So, passengers worry for their baggage. One of our baggage was damaged, one of our baggage arrived one day delay and three of our baggage arrived with 5 days delay.",210 seats per row in Economy
EVA Air,"Great cabin crew, awful Heathrow ground staff. On the outward journey from Bangkok to London, the cabin crew were wonderful: totally professional and really helpful, but the ground staff at London Heathrow were shockingly bad on my return. The check-in staff were impatient and rude from the outset, telling me Move along the queue and stop wasting your time when I began to enter my details in the Eva Air online check-in machines provided for that purpose. My passport was scrutinised and refused because of a small tear on a blank page at the back of my passport.  The check-in manager ripped off the luggage tag from my bag when the decision had been made that I could not fly. This was unsmilingly delivered with no explanation, unnecessary and humiliating. This failure of Eva Air Heathrow ground staff will cost me approximately $1,200 to book a new flight. In spite of my very pleasant outward journey with Eva Air, I won't be travelling with this airline via London again. The London Heathrow staff made this a miserable experience for me.",decision had been made that I could not fly
EVA Air,"Have flown EVA a number of times in both Business and Premium Economy on this route and have been more than happy. This return leg was in Economy as unable to upgrade, having tried to contact BKK ticketing office for 3 days. The flight layout was supposed to be 3-3-3. On entering the plane noted that it was 3-4-3. We were sitting in the middle and I was on the outside with my wife in one of the middle seat of the 4. First thing. Noted how tight leg room was given the seat layout I couldn’t put my right foot flat on the floor. This was my first time in a 10 across format and compared against Thai Airways 9. I wouldn’t have booked if I’d known was 10 and again time of booking was only showing 9. Crew were very efficient. Food was very poor both meals and not a patch on Singapore Airlines as a 5 star comparison. The temperature on board was too low. People were putting on coats and requesting second blankets and hot drinks. I would not fly Economy with them again. Would this experience stop me using them again in other cabins, maybe not. But it’s a tough ask in Economy on this plane specification for 12.5 hours. Whilst Thai Airways is not as polished in terms of staff it’s a better experience on a 12.5hr Economy flight.",would not fly Economy with them again
EVA Air,"We paid for three seats not knowing it was next to emergency door exit, it was a chaos from ticketing, wheel chair handling, we were asked by 3 stewardesses about emergency door and in case of emergency. We told the third stewardess that if they believe we cannot perform the task to just move us to a different seat and refund the money that we paid for the seat because the we are tired of being asked three times. The seat is not comfortable, not made for a long flight.",seat is not comfortable
EVA Air,"As a solo traveler, I arrived in Bangkok on EVA BR211 from Taipei and returned on EVA BR68 both in economy class. This trip has confirmed my earlier experiences with the company, such as traditional style mixed with comfort and the always kind, smiling, and helpful cabin crew. Easy and automated check-in, quick boarding, spacious and comfortable seats with soft blankets and pillows, and more than enough in-flight entertainment. As for the meal, I chose the lacto-ovo vegetarian menu which was satisfying and well-prepared. The bread was warm and fresh, and the main dish served with freshly cut fruits was flavorful.",traditional style mixed with comfort
EVA Air,"Bangkok to Taipei. I had an 11 hour layover at Taipei airport which wouldn't have been a problem if it was during the day. However, the plane was delayed by an hour and didn't land until 10:30pm. The food courts had closed by the time everyone had disembarked, even the lounges were closed which is unacceptable when you're paying an eye watering amount for a business class seat. Why on earth would EVA Air have an 11 hour layover at night when nothing is open and there aren't any sleeping facilities like pods. I can't recommend them purely on their insane layover times",I can't recommend them
EVA Air,"With so much praise has been given to EVA Air's Royal Laurel Class, I was looking forward to my flight to Bangkok. The experience began at the check-in desk, which was swift and friendly. The boarding was also methodically carried out, with business class passengers invited first. The cabin has a 1x2x1 layout with a reverse herringbone configuration, and mine by the window. The decor was pleasant, with olive green, shades of grey and brown colours. The seat itself looked cosy and comfortable. Settling down, I took a moment to explore the settings. The armrest could be lifted or lowered. There was the usual adjustable reading lamp and areas for storing small items and drinks. The seat adjustments at first looked complicated, but I eventually got the hang of it. The TV monitor was set at an angle opposite and had to be clipped open to be viewed. Headphones were also in their own compartment. The fold-out table was especially large and sturdy. Good quality slippers, Jason Wu designer pyjamas and a decent amenity kit were also provided. PJs were really welcome and should be standard on long-haul journeys. Once boarding was complete, pre-departure drinks came. When I requested Champagne, I was told it is prosecco for now, but champagne with supper. Seemed rather odd! At cruising altitude, the 'supper' service began. The menu was displayed on the monitor, and there was a good selection of soft drinks, spirits, wines, and teas. I had pre-ordered my main course for both 'supper' and 'refreshment' meals. The seafood main course of tiger prawns, with cashews in a spicy bean sauce, vegetables, and rice was delicious. But the choice of wine was just red or white. For afters, it was cheese and biscuits, with walnuts and pieces of fruit. However, I was disappointed to see a branded package of mini Jacobs crackers - it just cheapened the presentation. In my experience, biscuits and crackers should be served loose. The service was rather rushed, with no drinks refills unless asked for. I also had to ask for a coffee before tucking into sleep. Once 'supper' was over, the cabin crew just retreated to the galley area until two hours before landing, when a 'refreshment meal' was served. My main course was an Asian affair - noodles with shrimp won ton, char siew pork and other dim sum items which was tasty, and this time asked for champagne and got it. EVA Air offers an excellent business class hard product. The cabin crew, although polite, were just not engaging. The was a lack of proper etiquette and finesse when serving food and drink or attending to passengers. However, it did not deter me and I did enjoy my flight all the way to Bangkok.",I did enjoy my flight
EVA Air,"Taipei to San Francisco. My flight was on August 18 2022 on BR 18 from Taipei to san Francisco I have a condition called OAB (over active bladder) and that's why I always wanted to sit near the lavatory because I always have to empty my bladder every 30 mins. On that flight I was on 73H last row, aisle sit right side and behind me was the lavatory. Since I got into the plane I rushed to the lavatory behind my seat and it was occupied. I waited for 15 mins and a flight crew approached me and told me to just use the lavatory on the other side and that was fine with me since it was vacant. But mid flight I noticed every time I went to that lavatory it was always occupied and I was forced to use the left side lavatory or on the lavatory on the middle part of the plane. But one time I caught a flight crew came out on that lavatory behind me and as soon as she came out she suddenly locked the lavatory from outside and make it appear that it was occupied but nobody was using it and the reason they are locking it from outside so that nobody can use that lavatory except for them (crew). It was a horrible flight for me because I badly need to use a lavatory to empty my bladder I have one behind me but that crew on that flight are using it exclusively so I have to use the other side but it always had a long line or the lavatory on the middle part of the plane which is too far from my seat.",a horrible flight for me
EVA Air,"I paid for a reservation of a specific seat and they confirmed with my online ticket. After arriving at the airport i received a ticket for a different seat. After approaching the staff about this, he pretty much told me that this is my problem and he wasn't going to do anything about it. Once again it was a paid seat and they did nothing to compensate the loss for me.",did nothing to compensate the loss
EVA Air,Eva Air's slogan 'Striving for Perfection' is a strong strap line yet standards have fallen since Covid. I have used Eva on the London to Bangkok route since they started flying from Gatwick in 1994. Unfortunately my first post Covid flight there are a number of issues which need to be addressed. The In-Flight entertainment is not what it used to be with limited choice and a really difficult navigation issue where one has to select ones mood before a small choice appears. Food was mediocre and the vegetarian bread roll is served cold yet standard fayre comes with a hot roll. The evening meal was excellent with fresh salmon and potatoes but my breakfast hash was disgusting.,entertainment is not what it used to be
EVA Air,"We are flying back to Taiwan and I unfortunately got covid, which resulted in a 300 pound change fee. Just before our next flight my wife got covid and this time we were charged almost 800 pounds. I understand there may be a change fee, but they added the cost of the flight at that time, rather than what we originally paid. The customer service team were neither helpful or sympathetic to our situation. They simply said they could waive the change fee of 75 pounds with a positive PCR test. As we know a PCR fit to fly costs well over 100 pounds. The logic and competence shown was awful. We have now paid over 1,100 extra with no apology or compensation given. Also, as they are only flying once a week, we have had to delay work for two weeks. Never will I fly with this airline again. I would have been fine with paying the flight change fee, but to add an additional cost of 800 pounds is an insult.",no apology or compensation given
EVA Air,Beware of cancelation fees even when the airline canceled your ticket. My ticket for April 2022 got canceled due to the new covid policy issued by Taiwan government. Still the airline will not give you back 100% of the ticket.  Hence i rebooked another ticket again thinking it was just 1 plane got canceled. And immediately canceled that ticket in an 1 hour stretch. Airline refused my cancelation request and charged me penalty.,not give back 100% of the ticket
EVA Air,"EVA Air is a great airline, in the air, less so when there is a problem on the ground. My return to Taipei from Chicago was cancelled three times (September 4, 6, 9).. I believe that they could do better in customer service, particularly in rescheduling. On Friday, I called about my cancelled flight; the phone rep did not suggest any alternative itineraries (I can't wait two weeks for the ORD route to open up). I suggested flying through Houston instead of Chicago. The rep told me that my new flight plans would not be confirmed until Monday (and that there may or may not be a fee for changing my itinerary). I decided today to cancel and fly another airline. The representative could not tell me what my refund would be. She instructed me to email the EVA office in Chicago and they would let me know when they get back to work after the holiday. The website and app are adequate for booking a ticket, but seem worthless to deal with any problems. And, if the app/website is worthless for rebooking, why can't the phone reps give firm answers about rebooking and fees?",not tell me what my refund would be
EVA Air,"Be wary of purchasing tickets for EVA air flights. The lower fare belies the issue with the layover transit ban in Taipei. Although a small screen on a page will alert you to this ban, it states that the ban will be in effect for only a month (until Aug 31, 2021 as of this writing). Some people are willing to risk having their flight canceled. However Taipei has a history of extending this ban every 30 days since May 2021.  If we had known that Taipei had a record of protracting their transit ban, we would not have purchased this ticket. Ultimately, we canceled our booking, paid the $120.00 surcharge and booked a direct flight with another airline out of LAX just for peace of mind.",layover transit ban in Taipei
EVA Air,"The airlines cancelled my flight due to limited flight. My original flight is May 20. Due to this changes I have to make changes also on my connecting flight. I asked to move it to June 11. I was told that I can only picked a date between May 24 to June 2 and for Monday, Wednesday, Friday. I asked to speak to manager if I can change it to June 11 since they are the one who decide to cancel the flight coming out of Manila on Tuesday and Thursday. The representative said that the manager will tell me the same thing because its a company policy, and told me i will have to pay the difference or cancel the flight and book it somewhere else. I understand they're trying to consolidate their trip but if you are the one who's causing the inconvenience of customer, you should be able to be flexible.",pay the difference or cancel the flight
EVA Air,"A bad experience. I appreciate that Taiwan prides itself on efficiency, but perhaps a little more attention could be spared to hospitality. On the plus side, the flight was on schedule and the plane was very clean. On the minus side, one meal for a five hour flight and nothing else, not even passing through with a tray of water in a plastic glass. The seat selection was a bad joke: the plane was 90% empty, but on the online seat selection I was offered a choice of only two seats, neither at a window, both at the aisle. In the days of Covid, surely a window, seat is further from people walking down the aisle? The attitude of the cabin crew was frosty.",one meal for a five hour flight
EVA Air,"My trip was a group booking for a school field trip before most flights were affected by the pandemic. Our actual flight was cancelled due to COVID, but we were quickly rebooked to the next available flight. Service was good - ground service for group booking (we were a group of 30+ people) was excellent and check-in was seamless. Food served was excellent - for a 2 hour flight, we were served a full meal. Crew wore masks (no PPEs yet as there were still no outbreak at the time), but you can see the courteousness and sincerity in their service. Even got some playing cards to pass the time! Would recommend flying with them again.",Service was good
EVA Air,"I was fortunate to check in for my flight back to the USA the night before the flight. The challenge for me, though, was being able to check in my bag right at an hour before departure from Seoul, as I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to make it to the airport in time via public transport in the early morning. Happily, that wasn't a problem. I was able to make it to the check-in gate right on time, the staff were friendly and checked my bags with no issues. Gate staff in Seoul and Taipei were pleasant. The flights to Taipei and then to Los Angeles were drama-free. I found the cabin and lavatories clean and staff courteous. I did find the seats slightly more cramped (maybe just my perception) and in-flight entertainment and meals to be a little boring, though, compared to previous experiences using JAL and Singapore, these still fare better than most North American carriers in my opinion. All in all, a positive experience returning to the USA. I'll value professionalism and cleanliness, with friendliness as a bonus, any day before watching the coolest new Hollywood flick.",a positive experience returning to the USA
EVA Air,"London to Taipei during the pandemic. EVA only sells full fare ticket during this period so my tickets cost double of the usual price. However this is totally understandable, and I was able to select my seat once the ticket is booked. Check in at Heathrow was bit chaotic but this was due to the airport organisation to ensure social distance (which in my opinion only creates more queue than distance). EVA has requested some forms to be filled prior to checking in and also Taiwanese government requires online registration so they can monitor each single arriving passenger. The queue to reach check in took around 90 minutes. Once check in was performed it was very smooth to go through security. After security the only shops opened were Boots and WH Smith. Boarding was in good order. EVA enforced boarding zones to reduce congestion. Temperature of all passengers were taken and recorded. The crew members were in full PPE (goggles, facial mask, glove and apron) but still welcome passengers with a warm smile. The plane is a 3 year old B777-300 but it was spotless. EVA planes are perhaps the cleanest among all but it's evident that special cleaning had been implemented during this period. Most of the Taiwanese passenger also wore personal PPE and everyone was wiping their seat/table/screen once onboard. The flight pushed back some 30 minutes behind schedule due to delay on ground service. We were given amenity kits, blanket and a bottle of water while we wait on the ground. We were served two hot meals throughout the flight - one dinner and one breakfast. Both meals were tasty. They also announced few times that food and drink service was altered to meet additional hygiene standard. Toilets on the plane was kept spotless through the journey in a typical EVA fashion. Choices of movie/TV was limited. This has never been the strong point of EVA and perhaps during this tough time for aviation this has been cut back further. However I was still able to find some movie and TV programs to keep me occupied when I wasn't sleepy. The 13 hour flight passed quick and it was a very quiet 13 hours. All passenger wore their mask throughout. The flight landed in Taipei 20 minutes later than schedule but it only took me less than 30 minutes to leave the airport - that included buying a new SIM card, finishing the health screen registration, passing immigration and collecting luggage. The luggage was also disinfected before they reached the belt. It was a fantastic flight - very calm and relaxing despite the various measures enforced. The cleanness of the plane and the strict service procedure was reassuring.",It was a fantastic flight
EVA Air,"For weeks, I've been trying to contact EVA Air regarding a refund or rescheduling of four flights between NY and Tokyo in July 2020 because of the COVID-19 travel ban. The refund form on the website returns an error although I put it the valid ticket numbers from the reservation that there on the same website. They removed all email addresses from the contact so that is impossible to contact customer service. Left only phone numbers that, if you call, play a recorded message that they can't take your call.

EVA Air,"Los Angeles to Bangkok via Taipei. EVA Air is an excellent airline. I have flown them almost exclusively. Great service, food is decent, and they are highly recommended. However, in this era of COVID, they appear to be using the virus as an excuse for some sort of bridge loan, from their customers. I had to cancel a recent flight to the US, and they tell me it will be fully refunded. Within 90 days! Yes, you heard that right.

EVA Air,"Vienna to Bangkok. We were travelling with my Mom (she's in need of a wheelchair) - Check-in in Vienna was done within 5 minutes, the agent reseated us to the first economy class row which means a lot more room and comfort (especially for an elderly person). Cabin crew was very nice, attentive and supportive right from the beginning. The flight itself was easy going, I was amazed by the amount of cabin crew members because you do not find that onboard of western airlines anymore. Food was above economy standard, the only downside was the entertainment system. It was sufficient but nevertheless limited. Wheelchair service at Bangkok airport was very well organized, the cabin crew informed us right before landing about the available ground staff services. Everything said applied also for the return flight, this time the transfer agent at Bangkok airport changed our seats and so we had again the pleasure of bulkhead seats.

EVA Air,"This trip to Jakarta makes my 26th trip on EVA Air between Houston and Jakarta. I have looked at other airlines and even at slightly cheaper prices, is just not worth it for me to try someone new. This flight is a late night departure from Houston and to my surprise while waiting to board, I was called to the desk and given an upgrade to Premium Economy on the Houston to Taipei leg of the trip. Boarding as usual done very efficiently following the group numbers. This time I had a window seat, which usually I would never select for this 15.30 hour flight, however, my seatmate was a very nice young man who did not mind having to get up when I needed to move out of my seat. The service as always was excellent, I mean I have yet once to have a bad experience with service with this airline. The flight attendants were just wonderful and so pleasant. I obviously try not to become a pest but those times that I needed to interact with any of them in flight it was just very pleasant. The Premium Economy product is excellent, nice comfortable seat and all the amenities - blanket, pillow, head phone, sandals and toiletries. The IFE product, for me far more than I needed, ample movies and music, games and tv shows. On the music area it has a great feature that you can save lots of music to a play list and then you can listen to it. I listen to classical music while I sleep so I save tons of songs to the play list and listen for hours while sleeping. Food, always excellent, hot and tasty and always more than enough. The bathrooms are always clean and certainly you can see the flight attendants take care of the bathrooms numerous times during flight.

Whether it's before the trip or during, it's so efficient that I'm using that word over and over again. Well trained and personable staff. Food was I'd say standard and IFE I don't even recall to really comment. Counter check in was smooth in Taiwan in our return flight but very long in Manila. Very good experience. What this special was we were able to get a very goo price because of a promo so it's probably one of the best value trips I've flown.",Well trained and personable staff
EVA Air,"Toronto to Chiang Mai via Taipei. I have flown with a lot of airlines since 1977 and I must say EVA Air is one of the best. Nothing is always 100%, however, EVA makes sure there are no surprises and that you are always informed. Download the app and you are always getting notifications - Online Checkin 48 hrs before, your baggage is loaded, transferred to next flight, gate number etc. They let you know if there is a delay and why and also provided refreshments. Lots of helpful ground and inflight staff. Inflight staff are always around and on their feet. Toilets are cleaned regularly(rare with other airlines I have used). Lots of legroom on the flights I was on. Food was good with options indicated on the menu. If buns are served they are actually soft and you can cut them and spread the soft butter provided. Unlike some other airlines that serve a hockey puck and frozen butter. Attendants are all very polite and helpful. My one complaint would be that they should use someone with good English speaking skills for announcements, on a couple of my flights the announcement was pointless, as it was unintelligible.",EVA Air is one of the best
EVA Air,"Harbin to Seattle via Taipei. Absolutely brilliant customer service - from check in at Harbin when they were having system difficulties, to arriving very late in Taipei, and not just getting me onto my connecting flight with NO minutes to spare, but ensuring my suitcase also made it.

EVA Air,Vancouver to Manila via Taipei. Good check in at Vancouver with all lounge passes given at that time. Very well organized staff. Business class passengers get a special room where its quieter than the rest of the lounge. Good selection of food and drink. Boarding smooth and left on time. Upon arrival in Taipei informed my connection will be twelve hours late because of a typhoon. My checkin pieces were a tv and a duffle type of bag. TV was okay but the bag was destroyed and wrapped in plastic to keep contents inside. Showed the EVA rep and was compensated for my loss which saved me trip to the EVA office at a later time.,well organized staff
EVA Air,"Paris to Bangkok via Taipei. Overall is quite good except the food. I did not find many meat in EVA air meal. Taste is quite lite. For wifi, there is complimentary  30 MB, but it was quite slow.",quite good except the food
EVA Air,"Tokyo to San Francisco via Taipei. EVA needs to understand the oversized baggage limits. I brought my stuff to NRT 2 days prior to flying out, and EVA cleared them. However on the day of the flight they overcharged me, and referenced figures which I could not find.  Cabin Attendants were ok, attentive, and present. IFE was horrible vs ANA, and SQ. BR28 boarded late, due to aircraft not ready for flight. First drink round was a disaster, and passengers, like me got nothing. Had to call for a drink, Head Cabin Attendant came out and served me herself. Meals were good, other drink rounds were good, Cabin Attendants were present. My IFE was a disaster, with an extremely limited selection. Landed at SFO late. Had to approach the 3 EVA ground staff at the Luggage Carousel and was pointed to where to get my luggage. EVA’s ground staff were a disaster, in the air EVA does good.",pointed to where to get luggage
EVA Air,"Taipei to Shanghai. EVA Air maintained its high standard on this flight. My seat was very comfortable and had a very large amount of legroom even though it was only a 1h 30min flight. My seat was near to the lavatory, thus it was a “bad seat”. However, I faced no problem with the proximity but rather, I enjoyed the seat as the 3-4-3 configuration became 2-4-2 at the end, giving me more space on the aisle. Furthermore, breakfast was great — scrambled egg was delicious. The flight attendants were friendly and helpful as well, giving me drinks I requested for very quickly even though they were very busy. We departed and arrived on time.",maintained its high standard
EVA Air,"Osaka to Taipei. Everything went very well on the ground, despite a delayed departure due to traffic. The ground crew was friendly, polite and patient. We boarded quickly, the cabin crew seemed less welcoming, with no smile for me. I don’t eat pork for religious reasons. So I asked twice what the menu was and what were the ingredients used. I have been told by the crew that the menu was seafood with noodles. I started to eat my meal when I noticed that some of the meat was definitely not seafood. I called the crew, requiring more information, and was advised the menu contained pork.  A mistake can happen, but what struke me was the insensibility and careless attitude of the cabin crew.  I wanted to share my experience with a crew member when I left the plane, the response I received was a “thank you bye bye”. My first impression of Taiwan has been ruined by this experience.",I don’t eat pork
EVA Air,"Shanghai Pudong to Taipei Taoyuan. When I found out that the aircraft I was flying on had a 3-4-3 economy class configuration, I was worried. However, after boarding, I realised that my seat, 72H, was the second last row and thus, the seats were in a 2-4-2 configuration. Thus, the aisle space was very wide and the seat was very comfortable. Despite the seat being near to the toilet, this was not much of a problem. Furthermore, legroom was plenty and the seat was wide. The Inflight Entertainment was large and responsive, but offered a limited variety of movies. There was only one seatback pouch and it would have been nice to have additional storage areas like additional pouches for smaller things. Food was served on this 1h 30min flight and it was surprisingly delicious for such a short flight. The cabin crew were friendly and helpful. However upon arrival in Taipei, we waited on the tarmac for 30 mins before finding a gate space for us to park at. Other than that, the overall flight experience was good.",the seat was very comfortable
EVA Air,"BR17, SFO-TPE on a 777-300ER. Tickets bought 5 months out, and quite a favorable price. Check in at SFO, was weird. Staff didn’t want to take my oversized luggage, until I suggested they get a bag like ANA, Singapore Airlines, or Asiana. Once they processed my luggage it was fine. TSA/Security the usual disaster, and no one taking charge. Apparently the SFO cleaning crew was on strike 10 Nov, because both EVA flights, SQ, Asiana, and others were delayed for aircraft cleanliness. We were delayed for over 60 mins. Boarding went smoothly. Cabin crew were smiles and polite for 01.00 in the morning. Once we had push backed and airborne the meal service commenced. Dinner was nice with Hagen Daaz. Drink/Cabin service continued throughout the flight. Seat was perfect as I slept like the dead. The lights were activated, and a excellent sign, for waking everyone up for breakfast. Breakfast was yummy. Landed in TPE late, but still made my connection. BR184, TPE-NRT on a 787-900 boarded and took off late due to a aircraft issue. Still landed on time at NRT. Cabin Attendants polite, professional, and all smiles. Handed out immigration documents while still at the gate. Constant drink runs, and a tasty meal. EVA’s 787 seat was comfortable, and I was able to stretch out. EVA ground staff needs to be more professional, and expeditionary like ANA, and Singapore Airlines. Other than that they were superb! I will fly them again!",they were superb
EVA Air,"Brisbane to London via Taipei. Overall, EVA Air has a good product. The aircraft are clean and modern, food of reasonable standard, and Flight Attendants efficient. As Australians, and hence English speaking, communication was at a minimum with us. Announcements were very difficult for me to hear on all flights. Premium Economy seats were good, but passengers in front reclined seats for full journey, making our seats and activity in flight very uncomfortable. TPEL airport is not customer friendly when you need to transfer, and seems to be focused on Asian passengers. EVA Air scheduled a day layover on return leg from Paris to Taipei, but this was not a easy process for viewing the city, with delays at security.",EVA Air has a good product.
EVA Air,"Vancouver to Manila via Taipei. My wife and I called Eva Air Manila office to follow up on our lost luggage. We explained our side about how we lost it and how many luggages we checked in, And this employee the way he replied implied that it’s our fault that we lost our luggage.  As my wife is complaining about it she asked for get his full name, he answered that he can’t give his full name and hung Up! This experience from their Manila office is unacceptable customer service.",follow up on our lost luggage
EVA Air,"Seoul to Taipei. The flight experience itself is very correct. However, at arrival in TPE I went to fetch my baggage and noticed that the new cover I bought as a protector for my Rimowa was damaged and I can no longer use it. EVA ground staff said that damage to covers is not compensated. Cannot understand this because it also costs money ($50).  Also when sending an email I get a standard email that they are looking forward for my patronage again. I'll choose to fly other airlines instead.",damage to covers is not compensated
EVA Air,"Flew from LHR to BKK return last week on premium economy. Overall a pleasant flight and will definitely recommend it again. Of course it's not as good as their business class but it represents great value. Check in at both Heathrow and Bangkok were super efficient. At Bangkok despite there being multiple flights leaving at the same time to Europe and Taipei, the check in lanes for business and premium economy were empty and the check in process took less than 5 minutes. This is far superior than most of the European business class check in experience (BA/Air France and KLM in particular). Flights took off on time and landed ahead of schedule. The seat itself was very comfortable - I found the seat to be more spacious than those on Cathay Pacific. Service on the outbound flight was efficient and standard but on the way back the crew was very friendly and professional. The plane was clean, food was tasty and the crew walked around the cabin few times offering water and food post main meal. There is never a long queue for the toilet. The big let down with EVA is the limited choice of movie/TV programme. I was lucky I found a Taiwanese TV drama that I wanted to watch otherwise you'd better preload your ipad with Netflix or BBC Iplayer. There was also an incident when we landed in Bangkok. Due to heavy thunder and rain the airport ground service was suspended but no information was given. Had to wait for 2 hours for the luggage to come out. Compared with my last EVA premium economy flight (2 years ago), I personally feel that sadly the service has declined - although it's still above most of the airlines premium economy. The toilets in premium economy on my previous flight was spotless and I think they have reduced the frequency of cleaning. Nevertheless EVA is still a great option to fly to Asia from US/Europe. Their business and premium class products and services are will above the competitors.",Overall a pleasant flight
EVA Air,"San Francisco to Taipei . Always a great experience with EVA Air. Website, price, food,entertainment, service, check in, luggage, no problems or surprises, 4 times using them. Recommend them.",Always a great experience
EVA Air,"Toronto to Taipei via Tokyo. EVA Air was the first Asian carrier I've flown on and my first experience in long-haul business class. From this point I am completely sold on them. The quality of the service and food on both my flights was fantastic. The cabin crew in Business Class are very attentive and quickly are at your seat as soon as your glass or plate is empty with another drink or meal course. As someone who works in the aviation industry I am all too familiar with the intricacies of an airline from front-line to behind-the-scenes. All four of my flights departed on time and when faced with a difficult situation (arriving 35 minutes prior to departure due to an airport-access issue) the ground staff were accommodating and whisked me through security. Surprisingly my baggage also made the flight which was something I was concerned with. If I had to find a negative it would unfortunately be the Plaza Premium lounge EVA Air uses in Toronto. This lounge was extremely basic and the food/drink options were minimal. For an airline who prides themselves on their quality I'd have expected them to opt for a better lounge option. On the other hand, their Infinity Lounge in Taipei was the complete opposite (obviously being that it is at their hub they have more control) with ample food, drink, and comfort options.",I am completely sold on them
EVA Air,This was my return trip back to the US after 3 weeks in Indonesia and Malaysia. The seat was very comfortable though I did not make use of the sleeping position as it was a day flight and I was not tired. The meal service was impeccable with various options for selection. I selected the filet mignon and it was superb. The service was exceptional and the flight attendant addressed me by name. She was very pleasant and friendly though sometimes I had a little hard time understanding her English. We managed and everything went well. Certainly this would be an awesome seat to fly the 15-hour trip. I was very impressed and more so very grateful for the upgrade. That was such a pleasant surprise. I will soon be returning to Indonesia in a few months and there is no other way to fly there for me but EVA Air.,no other way to fly
EVA Air,"Taipei to Houston. This was my home leg on a trip that started in Jakarta. Once landing in Taipei, only had less than one hour to make the transfer to the Houston flight so I was trying to walk as fast as I could. As is always the case our arrival gate was way way down from the transfer area, I thought it was a mile walk. As I approached the transfer area there were two employees of EVA Air announcing the Houston flight and I said I was going there, then they asked my name and I told them and to my surprise they handed me a new boarding pass that upgraded me to Premium Economy on the Taipei Houston flight. I was dumbfounded bue very appreciative of this gesture by EVA Air. I managed the transfer i and arrived at the airplane like 15 minutes before departure. Having tried the premium economy product before, I proceeded to settle on my seat for the long flight home. Shortly after take off we were served our dinner. The PM product has one additional serving of food, akin to an appetizer. All the food served was very good tasty and proper temperature, cold when needed to be cold and hot was needed to be hot. Service was flawless as it always has been for me with EVA. Shortly  after I slept for a while and missed the snack and then proceeded to watch movies and listen to music until landing. The second meal was also on point and I arrived rested and well fed in Houston. All in all this was my 6th trip with EVA and my 24th flight with them in 3 years and I have never been disappointed. I was very appreciative of the upgrades but my experience has always been great with this airline.",Service was flawless
EVA Air,"Houston to Taipei. This was my sixth trip to Asia on EVA Air in the last three years. I have friends that have recommended I fly on another airline and I honestly just refused. I have always had excellent experience with EVA Air up to now so why change. I am now a Gold Member of their frequent flyer program so I was able to check in using the Gold line. I was given a pass to the lounge at IAH and also for the Taipei Lounge once I arrived there. I was flying in economy, aisle seat first cabin. As always the seat was comfortable with all the required functions and with the pillow and blanket and earphones. First meal came by and as always excellent service and selection. I proceeded to go to sleep for a few hours and missed the mid flight snack but was awake for the pre landing meal. The flight attendants as always very pleasant and friendly. The bathrooms are always spotless and I know they do make various trips to clean the bathrooms on this 15-hour flight. All in all, it was a very pleasant experience as it has always been the case for me and EVA Air.",excellent experience
EVA Air,"Taipei to New York in June 2019. My family and I are regular flyers with EVA Air, and part of the reason has been its environmental care through its service. Our recent flight experience caused us some concern about the environmental care. One example was the use of plastic floss pick in the utensil bag.",plastic floss pick in the utensil bag
EVA Air,"Seoul to Los Angeles via Taipei. The food is decent, but not perfect. Boeing 777 was very old on both Los Angeles flights. The seats are not very comfortable. All my flights were delayed for from 30 minutes up to more than 1 hour. Hello Kitty Boeing 777 on TPE-LAX was horrible, old and the interior colors are annoying. Plastic forks and knives are not for 5 star airlines. Service on board was good. No slippers or toothbrush were provided on long-haul flights.",seats not very comfortable
EVA Air,"I use EVA frequently for work. Every single month. When the EVA strike was taking place many of my booked flights were cancelled with no compensation or apology. I was not given anything for the trips I had to miss and all complaints to EVA were shut down and ignored. Then when I had to miss a booked flight because of a family emergency I was not allowed to board the return flight I had already booked nor could I get a refund without incurring huge fees, equal to the price of the flight. The whole process is meant to charge you more and force you to book another flight, despite the fact you're already paid for the missed one in full. I arrived at the airport after a long and tiring trip trying to get home and had to book another seat at triple the cost even though I already had a seat booked on the flight. Very very disappointing, as EVA was one of my favourite airlines. Will not be reviewing my membership or flying with them again. Sad they treat loyal members this way, and no effort was made whatsoever from staff to help solve the situation. Just mechanical responses like sorry for the inconvenience.",Very very disappointing
EVA Air,"I was a little disappointed. I have flown this route (Taipei to Los Angeles) twice before in the same class and the service was much better and the food was much better. Compared to other 5 star airlines such as Qatar or Singapore, I consider EVA is more of a 4 star airlinee.",I was a little disappointed
EVA Air,"This was the first time that I have taken the nonstop flight between Taipei to Chiang Mai. I have always gone through BKK and up to CNX. The connection with my incoming flight from Vancouver was perfect and instead of arriving at CNX around suppertime, I arrived later in the morning. Once again, the flight crew are incredible, courteous, respectful, communicate well and helpful in any way needed. The food and red wine were great and I certainly was not hungry upon arrival. There is plenty of leg room on the 321 and this is a route that I will most definitely use again between CNX-YVR or CNX-YYZ. I never hesitate to recommend EVA to my friends coming over here from either Canada or the U,.S. The ground crew in Vancouver, where my trip originated are also great and really helpful.",There is plenty of leg room
EVA Air,"Vancouver to Taipei. I have flown EVA Airways several times over the last few years between Vancouver and Thailand, via Taipei. EVA is by far the very best airline in providing courtesy, respect, communication, excellent food and comfort. On this past trip I needed assistance being able to connect to the onboard WiFi. One of the flight attendants was extremely helpful in making sure that I could connect and she was great. She might have been the lead flight attendant. The food is incredible and served with class. The flights leave on time or even a bit early once everyone is onboard and they seem to arrive on time or very close to on time. The washrooms are immaculate. I have recommended EVA Airways to friends who have also taken the route from Vancouver to Thailand and come away with praise for this excellent airline! I have also taken the route from Toronto to Thailand and that fight and service is superb also,",praise for this excellent airline
EVA Air,"Toronto to Taiwan. Unfortunately, they responded very poorly for their foreign customers during the strike. Not aware of the strike, I purchased the ticket just days before it and only had to find out about the strike in the media when I was in Taiwan. EVA made no attempt to communicate, besides a text that the flight was cancelled 2 days before departure, during the travel peak season of late June. Tried contacting the office and submitted refund request on their website. Received about 20% of what I originally paid for, in my credit card refund. The crews cannot speak English and they communicate poorly with their customers. I would not recommend it, especially if you are a foreigner. Very poor communication.",Very poor communication
EVA Air,"Chicago to Taipei. While EVA deserves its reputation as a top airline, my most recent experience with EVA was not my best. During my 6/2019 flight from ORD to TPE, I had to call for a Flight Attendant 3 times for a beverage before an attendant came over. The flight attendants just disappeared after the first meal, that often happens on USA airlines, but I have never experienced that on EVA before. Another note: the plane was just a bit too warm to sleep well. I have requested to lower the temp on other EVA flights and usually, FAs do lower it a bit, but this time, my fault, I just too dispirited to ask, and I will dress more lightly on the return. My TPE to ORD return trip this week was canceled due to the ongoing EVA flight attendant strike that began 6-20-19. After I received email notification my return flight was canceled, I waited in a queue overnight at TPE airport 10 hours trying to rebook, I was #1131 of 1375. I was grateful EVA kept the ticketing desk open all night for those of us who were waiting, however, the six EVA agents stationed in front of the queue doing nothing productive but chatting with each other could have been better utilized at the ticket desk assisting customers to find alternative flights and lessening the waiting time. After 10 hours of waiting, I was assisted and offered different options for my return flight to the US. The agents were mostly helpful but seemed annoyed when I refused their initial offer of return flights with no seat assignment or were a lesser booking class than my original ticket. In the end, EVA agents were able to rebook/reroute me on a return flight with one stop. I will likely continue to fly EVA routes when there is a choice, however, given my experience with EVA this time, when I next book a flight, I will look at all flights options instead of EVA first.",flight attendants just disappeared
EVA Air,Tokyo to Toronto via Taipei. I must say this is one of the finest business class I had the pleasure to fly in. Flight attendants on both flights were excellent. Service quick and accommodating. Food was great. The flight attendants all had been extremely polite and always inquiring if they can be of assistance. The In Charge came around and introduces herself to all the business passengers. Plane was extremely clean on both flights. Washroom was obviously was continually cleaned during the flight. I would fly this airline again and would highly recommend EVA air.,one of the finest business class
EVA Air,"Eva Air has one of the best airline lounges I have used. The quality of the food in their Infinity Lounge in Taoyuan Airport is excellent while the selection is wide. They even serve Haagen Dazs ice cream in their lounge. However, the A330 plane they used for the Taipei-Manila leg was old. The seat was hard and uncomfortable. Moreover, the food that they served on business class was the worst business class meal I've tasted. Eva Air's service may be good but the business class seats on this A330 and the food were bad.",A330 plane was old
EVA Air,"San Francisco to Singapore via Taipei. Flying back from a holiday with my wife and a 3y/o daughter. Booked flights via an agency with a confirmed seat (all 3 of us seating next to each other). Expecting that the seats were all set, we were not able to see that the seats they had assigned are not seating next to each other. Upon sitting in the plane, a lady passenger said the seat is assigned to her, good thing she was okay swapping seat. Its just so disappointing that Eva Air knows that a single booking has been made and expecting to have all 3 of us seating next to each other (honest mistake, didnt bother to check the tickets for the seat numbers, expecting that they were all set since the booking made has assigned seats already) but then when you try asking for help from the San Francisco staff to check if we can have all seats together they say the flight is full and the tone is just not close to any customer service conversation. The flight was good, food was warm and delicious. I just found the cabin staff to be hurried and quite brusque.",The flight was good
EVA Air,"Bangkok to London. Flight was delayed by 2 hrs on my outbound flight causing me to miss my connection, delayed by 40 mins on my return. I drank only around 450ml of fluid through the duration of each flight, I was suffering from dehydration by the time we reached Heathrow. I found the cabin staff to be hurried and quite brusque and impatient.",delayed by 40 mins
EVA Air,"The flight was fine and I was very pleased with the outgoing flight cause we were served such delicious meals on board. Another passenger and I had discussed this on the waiting lounge for our connecting flight to Tokyo and how happy we were of the delicious meals we got served from Vancouver to Taipei. On the second leg of our flight to Tokyo, again we were served such delicious food. The other female passenger and I agreed again. Unfortunately, on my return to Canada on June 3, 2019, I was quite disappointed with the food.  I left the rest untouched and the appetizer was awful plus the cake tasted like it's from a cheap bakery. Taipei to Vancouver, I picked the pork cutlet. It was terrible and I couldn't eat it.  I asked the stewardess if Eva Air had changed catering service and she said she doesn't know. She told me she'll tell the supervisor but the supervisor never came to see me. It was so disappointing after I had been raving about how delicious the food was from Vancouver to Japan.",pleased with the outgoing flight
EVA Air,"Bangkok to London on EVA Air's Boeing 777-300ER in Premium Economy. Check in has two dedicated lanes for Premium Economy, so check-in was a quick 5 minutes, the queue for normal economy was huge. On-board the seats have more legroom and recline more, IFE screens are a little bigger, however I found the Movie, TV, Music selection really limited and only watched one movie. No noise cancelling headphones. I found the food was low-grade. The most annoying aspect of the trip is for anyone sitting in the last two rows is the constant noise, light and smell from the toilets, and traffic from the economy section behind was constant. The 777-300ER is a noisy aircraft compared to the A380 and A350 I would normally choose to fly on.",more legroom and recline more
EVA Air,Singapore to Vancouver via Taipei. Staff was very attentive and professional in service. Aircraft was clean and properly maintained with aisle access for every passenger.

EVA Air,"Paris to Taipei. Fantastic experience in Economy Class. Very kind and professional cabin crew who make you comfortable and understand the challenges you face when traveling with very young children. Food was really good, entertainment system was top-notch. The seats were very comfortable and we didn't struggle to sleep during our 12hrs+ flight. Great wifi, not streaming fast but fast enough to browse the web. Arrived on time and luggage were delivered promptly in Taipei. One of the best airlines you can fly with.",One of the best airlines
EVA Air,Taipei to Bangkok. I think onboard catering is good. I'm flying with new aircraft version so the seat will be config 3-4-3 so the seat pitch is ok (32 inch) but seat width is to small.

EVA Air,Seattle to Ho Chi Minh City via Taipei in August 2018. The website is not user-friendly and it was very challenging to find information at the time we purchased tickets (May 2018). We didn’t see the info of extra charge for picking the seats while purchasing tickets. We only found out that we need to pay extra for standard seats after completing payment.  We called customer service with hopes that our mistake would be forgivable by giving us seats without charges. We weren’t satisfied with the solution they provide that we have to wait till 48hrs before departing time to get a free seat or cancel the tickets.,We didn’t see the info
EVA Air,New York to Bangkok via Taipei. Amazing! Great service and food. Staff was friendly and attentive. Beds were comfortable. Bathroom were clean. I would definitely use this airline again.,Great service and food.

EVA Air,"Taipei to Phnom Penh. I have flown EVA air many times and gained many reward points with the Infinity MileageLands. I received an email stating they would expire in April, so I booked a flight for March. It seemed good, as it only cost me to pay the airport taxes ($30), other than that the flight cost was covered by the points. Though I received a confirmation code, the bad news was that I was put on a waiting list. Customer service line is really difficult, nearly impossible to get a human on the line at their customer service number 1-800-695-1188. When I finally got a representative to explain what the waiting list meant, I was told, I may be taken off at any time, but probably be notified about up to 1 week leading up to the flight. I waited, but no notifications came. Finally 2 days before the flight, I contacted the Taiwan office and  was told that the flight was sold out and I would not be able to get on the flight, or even buy a ticket for the flight. So, I was left without a flight option for that day. To get a refund of the $30 tax I paid, I would have to pay a $50 cancellation fee.  Their loyalty program does not work or reward at all, only served to make things difficult, cause me to book an extremely higher priced and longer duration flight. I would not recommend EVA as their loyalty program does not treat it's customers well at all.",EVA Air customer review
EVA Air,"Bangkok to London in Premium Economy. Although the incoming flight from Taipei arrived slightly late we boarded on schedule. Seat configuration in Premium Economy is 2-4-2. My wife and I were seated in seats A and C, which gives good space. Cabin crew service was very polite although without the charm of some of the other Asian carriers. The meals served during the flights were good, we had the chicken and rice as the main course, which was tasty. Good selection of recent released films meant the 13 hour flight passed quickly. Although the flight had departed a few minutes late but because of the continuing avoidance of Pakistan Airspace we arrived in London around 25 minutes late. There was a quite a long delay for the luggage. When travelling this route in premium economy the choice is between BA and EVA, but until BA retires the near 20 year old cabins on this particular sector then EVA is the only real choice.",EVA is the only real choice
EVA Air,"London Heathrow to Bangkok in Premium Economy. Check in at LHR T2 very quick and easy. Flight was about 20 minutes late due to the late arrival of the incoming flight due to the re-routing caused by airspace issues over Pakistan. This caused a late arrival in BKK and missed connection there but no fault of EVA Air. Seat was comfortable, I am 1.83m but no issue with legroom in premium economy. Cabin crew service was very efficient and the food was quite good, I chose the grilled chicken with noodles and it was quite tasty and moist. Drinks service is quite minimal, with small plastic cups for the wine, but not really an issue. I found the cabin a little cold for this overnight flight although the blankets provided were quite thick but a little small. Overall a good flight.",service was very efficient
EVA Air,"Ho Chi Minh City to San Francisco via Taipei. When my luggage arrived in Ho Chi Minh City it was damaged. After almost one hour of immigration line at SGN, I didn't want to stand in another line to report the damaged luggage so I reported it after one week when I got to SFO on my return leg. They took my complaint at SFO and informed me to email pictures, and a luggage tag once I arrived at my final destination, i.e. DFW, which I did. After some email contact, they never returned my request/inquiry and I was just dropped. I even followed up again for a final resolution but received no response. I asked for an aisle seat from Taiwan to SFO since I need to visit the lavatory often and at Ho Chi Minh City going back to San Francisco, I was confirmed an aisle seat by Eva Air staff. When I entered the cabin  I was sandwiched between passengers even though I had an aisle seat confirmed. I asked the in-cabin personal to please give me an aisle seat and they couldn't accommodate. The in-cabin service was good but to ignore passengers' special requests and damaged luggage are not ok.",I reported it after one week
EVA Air,"Jakarta to Houston via Taipei. This was my 5th trip in 18 months on Eva Air and as all other times this airlines does not stop to amaze me with their service. My flight from Jakarta to Taipei has always had a tight connection to the Houston flight in Taipei, however, this time our flight leaving Jakarta left and hour and a half late. About one hour before landing, I did mention to the flight attendant that I was concerned about the connection time due to the transfer process in Taipei. I was assured that I had a 40 minute window and should be ok. We landed at 9:40 p.m. then proceeded to a 10 minute hold for waiting for a gate. This turned out to be a 20 minute gate wait, we finally were able to deplane at 10:00. I was impressed because as I was exiting the plane the flight attendant I had spoken to earlier tap me to follow her and she rushed me out the door to a waiting EVA Air employee at the gate, in short order there was a relay of EVA Air employees from one place to the other until I arrive at the Houston flight just about as they were going to close the door. To my amazement, my luggage arrived in Houston with me as well. Short of amazing I really do not know how they did it. EVA Air, tops in customer service.",tops in customer service

EVA Air,"Los Angeles to Kuala Lumpur via Taipei. I always fly with EVA Air when I travel to Los Angeles, because of seat comfort, food selections, accessories provided (blanket, pillow, earphones) and the friendliness of the flight attendants. The seats are so comfortable that I could sleep well during the longer leg of my flights. The servings of the in-flight food and refreshment are generous enough to make me full. Plus, the food tastes reasonably good. Their blanket is big and thick enough to keep me warm throughout the flight. The flight attendants are very attentive to the passengers' needs. One time, I had acid reflux and was feeling really uneasy. The flight attendant gave me lemon soda water to make feel better and constantly checked on me if I felt better until we landed. I came to like EVA Air more when I almost missed my connecting flight today. Our time of departure from LAX was an hour delayed due to air traffic. My connecting flight to KUL was supposed to depart at 7am and boarding gate opens at 6:30. I knew then that I would surely miss my flight to KL when the flight info showed that our ETA in Taipei would be 6:35. I was worried because I missed my flight with another airline once before. Then, our flight from LAX was 1.5 hours delayed. Even though the plane landed 30 mins before the ETD, I was no longer allowed to take my connecting flight and so I just had to fly the next day. But this morning with EVA Air, they waited for me and some other fellow passengers whose first leg of the flight also departed late. I truly appreciate the airline's consideration of such unavoidable circumstances. EVA Air is really worth my money. Keep it up!",really worth my money
EVA Air,Taipei to San Francisco. This was my first time flying on EVA air in Royal laurel business class class. The flight was awesome. From the Rimowa amenity kit to the comfortable and stylish PJ's. The food was delicious and the service was excellent. The experience was almost on par to when I flew first class with Lufthansa. Really great airline!,Really great airline!
EVA Air,"New York to Ho Chi Minh City via Taipei. That was the first time I flew with EVA, and I would like to confirm all the good reviews others had. EVA Royal Laurel class easily exceeded the level provided by many other business classes. First, the airline served Krug Grande Cuvee, which could only be seen on top airlines' first class such as CX or SQ. They provided pajamas,  plus it was one of my preferred pjs that I kept using on subsequent business class flights that did not provide pjs. Catering was superb on both segments. Seats were comfortable, though they were just similar to other airlines' long-haul business class seats (it was amazing that the 3-hour TPE-SGN segment also offered similar seat). Boarding at JFK was a bit chaotic, but that was more a JFK thing. Overall, this is as close to first class as one can find.",close to first class
EVA Air,"Manila to Taipei flight was average. No In-flight Entertainment on 2hrs 20 mins flight, they should have device streaming. Food was delicious but there were no desserts. Drinks were minimal. However, it was a comfortable flight.",it was a comfortable flight
EVA Air,"Taipei to London via Bangkok. Excellent airline. First time flying with EVA and it was the best business class experience I have had. I have flown a lot of airlines in business and EVA outdid them all. Fantastic service from an excellent, caring and attentive crew. Super comfortable reverse herringbone seat, great bedding and pyjamas. Ordered Indian vegetarian meal and it was wonderful! This was a long flight, 18+ hours in total, EVA made the whole experience exceptional - I look forward to flying with them again. Thank you.",best business class experience
EVA Air,"Taipei to Amsterdam via Bangkok. The Business-Class product of EVA Air Royal Laurel is a near to perfection product. Food, service and seating are on a very high level and can easily compete with First Class products on the market. Impressive is, how they manage to serve high class gourmet food. I also appreciated the service of the cabin crew. They were incredibly friendly and efficient. The 1-2-1 reversed herringbone allocation of the seats offers a good amount of privacy. Airport services are really good. A welcome lounge service in AMS would have made the experience 100% perfect, unfortunately there is no such service available, but, I would choose EVA Air again for flights towards Asia and recommend them without limitations, especially in the business cabin.",near to perfection product
EVA Air,"San Francisco to Bangkok via Taipei. As expected, this was an excellent trip. The seats were comfortable and had good recline which made sleeping possible. The attention by the crew was excellent and they were responsive to passenger needs. The food was tasty and I enjoyed the meals but the presentation was not as good as it might have been. The dishes were a bit tacky and did not match the overall quality standards that were evident in every other aspect of the service. Minor thing, of course. I would rather have tasty food on plastic rather than crummy food on upgraded dishes. The IFE was excellent and provided more than enough options for the duration. It is very hard to fault them in any aspect of the trip. Highly recommend.",an excellent trip
EVA Air,"Manila to Taipei. Service is really impressive. I did not expect too much because it was just a very short flight. I was surprised that it was rather full service. Plane used was A321. Despite being a full flight, the cabin was not too cramp. It is good they have toilets in the middle of the plane. There was a decent meal. Blankets were provided. Earphones were provided. I particularly enjoyed the aromatherapy inspired amenities in the toilet, which I would only expect for longer flights. I flew the same route with Philippine Airlines before and noticed a clear difference of service.",Service is really impressive
EVA Air,"Paris to Jakarta via Taipei. I was very impressed with the service of Eva Air. The food was excellent, seats comfortable in Economy and more legroom in comparison ot other 5* airlines and not to miss a generous 30kg luggage allowance. The flight attendents were always going through to offer water and juices between meals. The toiletes were cleaned on a regular basis throughout the flight. Even before arriving at the destinations the toilets were as clean as at take off. Leaving Jakarta, our seats were changed by EVA as the IFE was not working at our reserved seats. Would not hesitate to use EVA Air again.",I was very impressed
EVA Air,"Manila to Amsterdam via Taipei. Customer service and overall experience from the ground staff and the cabin crew are just excellent and way beyond what most legacy carriers offer. Politeness and attentiveness of all EVA Air staff, particularly the ground staff at TPE, is just extraordinary. An amazing and comfortable journey always with EVA Air. Looking forward to fly with them again.",amazing and comfortable journey
EVA Air,"Los Angeles to Chiang Mai via Taipei. Excellent service from EVA Air counter and gate crew to their onboard staff. EVA Air planes are always clean and this long haul flight across the Pacific provided me with EVA Air's great onboard service. IFE, meals, and smiling crew members are difficult to beat. Once again they met and exceeded my expectations.",exceeded my expectations
EVA Air,"Houston to Jakarta via Taipei. This trip makes my 16th trip on Eva Air, (Houston/Taipei/Jakarta/Taipei/Houston in the last year and a half. This being my 4th trip to Indonesia, I have become more astute in looking at the available airlines to Jakarta from Houston. While the selection is not huge there are enough to offer some level of competition. The comment is due to the fact that I have been able to find cheaper air fare to Jakarta for this trip, I still opted to fly on Eva Air because I know I will be first class service in Economy. I cannot say enough about the level of excellent service in this airline. The seats, the entertainment selection and the food in economy are just tops. The service from the flight attendants, it is just above and beyond any US airline. The flight to Taipei was on a 777-300 and I selected seat 64G, it was an aisle seat very close to the rear bathroom and allowed me to move about the cabin without having to bother anyone. The seat was comfortable with ample leg room and enough seat recline for me to sleep comfortably for several hours. I also prepaid for the WIFI and was able to use my social media accounts without issue. I was not able to find a power outlet under the seat but the entertainment screen had outlets for power for my iphone and it was charged the entired trip. This was another excellent experience in Eva Air to Asia !!",another excellent experience
EVA Air,Taipei to Los Angeles. It was a really good journey. Flight attendants were very attentive. You got champagne as welcome drink and it was really good. The pajama provided on the long haul flight is very comfortable. I'm still wearing it at home. I had duck breast and it was surprisingly good. I'll totally fly with Eva again.,a really good journey
EVA Air,Taipei to Chiang Mai. Excellent service on an excellent airline. The staff is incredibly patient and fast. Aircraft is clean and I always have an on-time departure and arrival on EVA. This flight is with a single aisle aircraft but the mid-cabin lavatories make it easier.,an excellent airline
EVA Air,"Vancouver to Denpasar via Taipei. I have been living in Indonesia for the past two years, and have flown in and out of Indonesia every two months because of the temporary visa.  I arrived, and to my surprise said I was told I was not allowed on the flight unless I had a ticket flying out of Bali. I have always booked my ticket from within Indonesia and never needed or purchased a ticket before entering. Having done this for the past two years, I was quite surprised and very confused. The staff at Vancouver were extremely rude, one of them even said, how about instead of telling us how it is, you go and buy a ticket! I was so shocked at how rude she was.  There was no sympathy from these people. I was so angry, but fortunately I kept my cool. I will never fly with them again.",needed a ticket before entering
EVA Air,"Taipei to Bangkok. Check-in at a dedicated area, no fast track for security/customs though, but all went very fast. Nice lounge (Infinity), all you need is there. The best part of the flight is the flight attendants, both outbound, and inbound flights, they really are genuinely friendly, going out of their way to make you comfortable. Nice food, wines, and superb service. Many airlines can learn a lot from the way EVA treats their business class passengers!",really are genuinely friendly
EVA Air,"Hong Kong to Taipei return. A short get away flying with EVA on business after a 3 year break. This airline still got what it takes to earn the 5 star rating from Skytrax! The ticket was sold at a very competitive for J class, and luckily they deployed their nice 777 (with their lovely Royal Laurel Class fully flat bed), return with the solid A330 2x2x2 angle lie flat seat, both are more than sufficient for such a short flight of 90 minutes. The crew were lovely and proactive, a full hot meal with 2 choices were served, a great wine list and drinks available. In Hong Kong they use the newly renovated United airlines lounge. In their home ground Taipei the Infinity lounge, both were wonderful to spend time in. If they do promotions at low seasons, this is very worth considering.",the crew were lovely
EVA Air,Chiang Mai to Los Angeles via Taipei. Excellent service and clean aircraft. Check-in is orderly and my flights were on time. EVA is wonderful. The crews on this and all EVA flights are so well trained and professional.,well trained and professional
EVA Air,Denpasar to Chicago via Taipei. Took care of me the whole trip! Staff is extremely courteous! I felt so good about my choice with EVA AIR. Had a 19 hour layover and they booked me a beautiful hotel with breakfast and arranged transportation. Amazing airline. Very impressed,Amazing airline
EVA Air,"Chicago to Manila via Taipei. I arrived at the assigned check-in counter about 45 minutes before it was due to open and I was surprised to see a long line snaking around about 3 lengths long. I couldn't check-in online and I was worried that I couldn't get my desired seat. To my surprise the line moved quite quickly and I was soon up front. The lady at the counter wasn't very polite and seemed to be having a bad day. Luckily I was able to pick up the last window seat which I had wanted. At the boarding gate, we were told that our flight which was due to leave after midnight would be delayed. The group staff kept us constantly informed about the status of our flight. Boarding was done quickly despite the rush of passengers when it commenced. The cabin staff did a great job in serving the passengers needs despite the late departure. The person beside me made quite a few requests during the flight and it was calmly dealt with by the staff. The food I thought was good. A choice of beef or chicken for dinner. While the refreshments served a few hours before landing. The in-flight entertainment had a wide array of programming. Movies from Asia, European and Hollywood. The ear buds given were sufficient but I would have preferred a headset. For whatever reason I could not charge.my phone using their USB Port. I did not bother trying out the Wi-Fi as it was quite expensive. Overall my journey with this airline was a good one highlighted by the good service by the cabin staff.",cabin staff did a great job
EVA Air,"Bangkok to San Francisco via Taipei. This is the third time I have flown EVA business class to the US from Thailand in the last year. It just doesn't get any better! I can easily see why they are one of the top five airlines in the world. Everything from check-in, lounge access, in-flight experience, seat comfort, food quality is excellent. The flight attendants are friendly, well trained and make you feel very special during the flight; from making your bed to remembering your choices, incredible service second to none. The individual business class pods (1 x 2 x 1) on the 777's are the best in the industry and I have flown over one million miles. I pre-ordered my dinner selection from an extensive menu. The meal served was on par with any fine restaurant. EVA is always my first choice - highly recommend!",always my first choice
EVA Air,"Seattle to Bangkok via Taipei. We have travelled to Asia every year with various carriers. For the first time after 7-8 year, we flew EVA to Asia this summer. It was a pleasant surprise and we had a much nicer experience from checkin to luggage pickup. To start, the online checkin was without glitches. We were able to find information we needed, for example the number of luggage and the maximum weight of each piece. Checkin was efficient. Ground personnel at both SeaTac and Bangkok was pleasant and professional. We got enough time to use EVA lounge at Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport and were very impressed with the food & drinks. We were able to relax and catch up on the last minute things we had to do before flying out - thanks to the free wi-fi in the lounge! Onboard, we were impressed with the creative safety video which gives a creative touch to the same old content. Although the food was nothing to write home about, we did find the service exceptional. The cabin crew were helpful, friendly and professional. What we particularly like was the fact that they kept the washrooms clean throughout the long flight. We loved the inflight entertainment and the relatively bigger screen monitor although I personally missed the handheld controller which could make playing games much easier than touchscreen. Both ways, our flights were on time. This is very important especially when our flight is 10-12 hours long. The only downside we found was that the seats in our flights from/to North American are narrow and cramped, although we think EVA has bigger leg room than most carriers we had flown to Asia. We are thinking of flying EVA every time from now on and, for extra comfort, in premium economy!",a pleasant surprise
EVA Air,"Los Angeles to Manila via Taipei. Check-in from lax was a breeze as well as my transit through Taipei. I ordered the seafood meal in advance which was a little disappointing though since I felt like the food that I had all throughout the flight were just the same food with somewhat of little variation in sauces. I also like that they place snacks and drinks in the galleys so passengers can just get some in the middle of the flight if they get hungry. I do wish though that they did have a more filling mid-flight snack like sandwiches or what-not. Inflight entertainment was good although not excellent, wishing to have more choices in movies. Flight attendants are courteous but could be better. Overall a pleasant flight!",Overall a pleasant flight
EVA Air,"San Francisco to Manila via Taipei. The check-in counter at SFO was quite rude, maybe because of misunderstanding during the seat assignment. While it was me who asked her to change seat to window side instead of an aisle seat, she insisted that she assigned us to aisle and middle seat because the window seat is vacant anyway. Instead of answering to me directly, she talked and gave her explanation to my companion instead. The cabin crew service was excellent as they were quick to respond and provide drinks and snacks when I needed these because I could not sleep throughout the flight and was just doing my paperworks and watching movies.",cabin crew was excellent
EVA Air,Cabin crew superb are let down by abysmal catering. Row 27 seats don't recline as much as others. No mention at time of booking. These seats are near toilets but problem is compounded by the acceptance of Economy class passengers being allowed into Premium economy cabin to use.,abysmal catering
EVA Air,"Kinmen to Taipei Songshan. Domestic flight of Eva Air is operated by its subsidiary UNI air. This was a very short flight but the journey was seamless. Drinks was served and the cabin was really clean and tidy. Staff was really friendly and tidily dressed. The ticket price was slightly higher than other competitors, but you can really feel the differences. Surely will take their flights again.",Staff was really friendly
EVA Air,"Taipei to Vancouver on May 31, 2018. During the 10-hour flight, EVA cabin crew offered top-notch service that has made EVA AIR synonymous with customer satisfaction.  For over 20 years, EVA AIR has been my only choice of airlines when travelling between Canada and Taiwan. As I always say, I have found the best airline, why bother with the rest? On May 31, 2018, EVA AIR did it again, proving one more time that a happy customer is indeed a repeat and loyal customer.",top-notch service
EVA Air,"The lounge at Star lounge at TPE had no TWG tea bags. The salad bar moved to canned peas. On boarding the ground staff were chatting behind the desk and there were no pre-checks in the Zone 1 line. I looked around and noticed that I was the only one around in the Zone 1 line with a Zone 1 status.  When the boarding started, everyone cut the lines and it was chaos. Not the service I had expected. The inflight service was still top notch. The flight amenities in Rimowa bag is unbeatable, personal seat covers and one of the best lay-flat seats in biz class I've flown in. The attendant service and food are five star.",there were no pre-checks
EVA Air,"Manila to Taipei. This is my first time flying with EVA Air, I was so lucky that I got the best price for this short-haul flight. Even though the plane that they've used was a Airbus A321 which is normally used in domestic flights the legroom in the seats are beyond normal. The food is great and the flight attendants are alert to your needs. The best flight that I rode for short-haul international flight.",best flight that I rode
EVA Air,"This trip from Hong Kong to Toronto was a seamless five star experience. Check-in at HKG terminal one was instantaneous and my suitcase was tagged through to Tampa. The priority security line took perhaps two minutes and immigration was equally quick. The Star Gold lounge closest to our departure gate was the United Club, which was satisfactory. Boarding was disciplined and business class passengers were shown to their seats and greeted by name. We were immediately offered sparkling wine or juice and received the menu and wine list for the short flight to Taipei. The full meal was served on HKG-TPE; I chose the sweet and sour pork, and it was excellent. Once airborne, a good champagne ( DeLamotte Blanc de Blancs ) replaced the sparkling wine. In hindsight, I indulged myself too much in the lounge and on the short flight so that I was not able to really appreciate the headline long-haul flight TPE to YYZ. On that flight, they served Veuve Clicquot La Grande Dame, but I was only able to sample half a glass. I also short circuited the eight course dinner meal and skipped straight to the fruit plate. The flight attendants could not have been more eager to serve and please. They addressed passengers by name throughout the flight and did their best to anticipate any request. The seats on EVA's 777-300's are arranged in a 1-2-1 pattern and are wide and comfortable. However, passengers who choose window seats to enjoy looking out may be disappointed because you are seated a good distance from the window. We departed on-time, arrived 30 minutes early, and my suitcase made the trip unharmed. My principal regret is that I didn't discipline myself to have an appetite for food and drink on the long haul flight.",seamless five star experience
EVA Air,My luggage was damaged during the flight and one of the wheels came off. At HKG airport we reported the damage and were offered a new luggage of the same size. Waited almost an hour to see a smaller one brought over. They then asked me to wait for another 20 min so they bring a bigger one over. Our trip started out nicely with business class all the way from Toronto to Hong Kong via Taipei but ended quite disappointingly with luggage damage and a wait time.,trip started out nicely
EVA Air,"Manila to San Francisco via Taipei. Great Flight, definitely recommend. Spacious leg room for economy Class, good food and clean rest rooms. Just improve on the the Inflight entertainment and everything Will be perfect. Definitely my kind of airline.",definitely recommend
EVA Air,"I did not succeed in releasing boarding pass on internet. Ticket was bought in 2017 on Internet. Credit card was immediately charged. Now, at airport, in May 2018, because the airline requested the original credit card. As bank had released a new one, and changed the ultimate 4 digits, my check-in was initially put in hold during 20 minutes. At last, chief appeared and I was compelled to sign a document where I would authorize a new charge. Extremely unpleasant. Plane was 1 hour late. Food was very poor.",check-in was initially put in hold
EVA Air,"Traveled with my wife and daugther on economy class from Los Angeles to Manila via Taipei. One of their ground crew noticed that my daughter is a special needs child and politely asked if she is so. They then offered to transfer us to another set of seats where we'll be more comfortable (and even said they'll try block off seats for us in the process). We did not request any of this by the way. This trip was our first time as a family to fly EVA Air. Food was on par with other airlines. But the service we received in flight is to be commended. The flight attendant went out of her way to make my daughter as comfortable as possible. She would check on us every so often. She was very friendly, accommodating, and cheerful. She and her purser also did something for us which we appreciated very much (and again, no request was made on our part). We travel by air as a family three to five times a year and this (our LAX-TPE leg) is by far the best service we received from any airline be it business or economy class. Thank you EVA Air, and a special thank you to our flight attendant.",the best service we received
EVA Air,"Taipei to Tokyo Narita. Quick and smiley check-in. Star alliance Gold  lounge only offered cheap options of food and beverages. Aircraft was new and clean, but no individual screen. Flight delay on departure but the arrival was on time. Two meal choices offered  on board.",Quick and smiley check-in
EVA Air,"My third trip to Indonesia in 10 months and this time I decided to fly Premium Economy. It turns out that the premium economy only applies to the Houston/Taipei leg of the flight and the Taipei/Jakarta was on regular economy. Given that at the time that I bought the ticket, which was about two days before the flight and the fact that the additional cost to upgrade to Premium Economy was minimal, I think it was a good deal. The seat is wider than economy and the meal service a bit upgraded as are the pillows, the blanket and the amenities kit but in all honesty for me if the price difference is big, like double economy, I would not fly it. On this airline the economy product is great and really in my previous two trips I had no complaints on the service whatsoever. On an ongoing basis for me if travelling this airline the only way I would upgrade to premium economy is if the price is right, (and I have seen it as low as $200.00) All in all it was a great experience on a great airline.",a great experience
EVA Air,"San Francisco to Manila via Taipei. The ground staff was helpful. Particularly in Manila. While that is a different zoo altogether, SFO staff was particularly good. I do have to say that the check in staff in Manila was excellent. The food on all ways was nothing special. I wish they would provide beverage service at the same time. Sometimes, you have to wait for the beverage cart. The seats are comfortable enough for long haul flights. If you can get the exit seats, even better. The crew on all my flights spoke good English; sometimes, the purser is really hard to understand over the PA system. Transit thru Taoyuan International is also a non-issue. Just follow the signs. It can be unnerving if you have a short connection between flights because the second screening lines can be long. I wish they have two or three lines open all the time. Not sure if that’s EVA’s concern. I totally recommended this airline.",recommended this airline
EVA Air,"Taipei to Hong Kong, they only provide one cake and one juice for this flight which left me  disappointed. I will choose other airlines to Hong Kong or Macau for my flight.",provide one cake and one juice
EVA Air,"New York JFK to Brisbane via Taipei. EVA Air first 16 hour flight of my life. I was lucky enough to get 3 seats to myself and sleep. Also they have mobile service and WiFi on board. That's been a first for my experience. The foods amazing. Pillow, blanket and slippers supplied free. The staff are the best, most courteous and helpful I've ever come across. Toilets are cleaned constantly throughout the flight and include floss picks, ear plugs, eye masks, face moisturiser, and a face mist that makes you feel new again and toothbrushes. Their in flight entertainment is extensive and the leg room is generous. Over the moon with EVA Air! I'll be flying them again where I can.",Over the moon with EVA Air
EVA Air,"Houston to Jakarta via Taipei. Having flown EVA Air to Jakarta in May and having had such a wonderful experience, I decided to try them once again on the same trip. I had round trip on EVA Air to Jakarta in mid November for two weeks. This time the flight left around 40 minutes past midnight from Houston. The checking in and boarding was a flawless experience. My flight to Taipei was excellent and I experienced no issues whatsoever. I am really a very laid back person and do not bother the attendants unless I have to. During this flight there were a few people around me that made extensive use of the flight attendants and as always they are just very customer service focused and seemed fine with all the passenger issues they had to deal with. As before meal service was excellent as were the choices of meals and the quantity of food in economy. The seat was comfortable and I was able to sleep fine during the flight. The bathrooms, spotless, its actually quite amazing in an airplane with these many people for 16 hours plus.",very customer service focused
EVA Air,"This was my first time to Asia in a very long time and the first time flying with EVA Air. My experience started at check-in where the entire process was very professional and fast. Then on to the boarding. EVA Air boards by groups and they have the process very well defined as there was no crowding on to the boarding area because the lines queued pretty far from the gate agent. Once in the airplane the flight attendants all very friendly and efficient to make sure we make it to our assigned seats. This was to be a 16.30 flight to Taipei. I choose an aisle seat so as to have the ease to be able to get up at my convenience without having to bother anyone. The inside of the airplane was very nice and to me seemed spotless. My seat was very comfortable and I was able to sleep about 8 hours without any problems. We were served 2 meals and a snack, the meals offered a Chinese entree and a western entree, I chose the western entree on both meals and the food was excellent and plenty of food. The snack was a sandwich also very tasty. The lavatory that I used several times during the flight was always spotless, I was very impressed in the fact that I did see flight attendants going there during the flight and cleaning it. Very impressive. The service was flawless, the flight attendants service was impeccable and very professional. Upon arriving at Taipei, the transfer process to the next flight was impressive and very well handled. The flight to Jakarta was on a different airliner but the service was just as impressive. My return trip to the US on this airline was also flawless.",The service was flawless
EVA Air,"This was my second time flying EVA Air (return flight from Cebu to Vancouver via Taipei). I wrote an earlier review of my Vancouver to Cebu flight. Check-In - Quick and painless. Paid online for window seats through Flight Hub when I bought the return ticket in the fall but that was not honored by EVA. Was told that there is no such paid pre-flight seat selection arrangement between EVA and Flight Hub. Grrr! I griped about that in my previous review. Settled for an aisle seat. The check-in staff were efficient and courteous. Flight to Taipei - The plane was a gleaming A321 with the Hello Kitty livery. I thought that was cool as it added to the festive atmosphere inside the plane that was packed with returning tourists. Meals and IFE were identical to my previous Taipei to Cebu flight. The cabin service was fine but a notch below that of the longer Taipei to Vancouver leg. I suspect EVA uses less experienced flight attendants for the shorter flights within the ASEAN region. Flight to Vancouver - The screening of passengers from the waiting lounge to the actual boarding area one floor down left a sour taste in my mouth. I witnessed how a stern-looking young lady, possibly in her mid 20s, was berating a middle-aged Asian couple for supposedly not having the right documents to travel to Canada. A big part of the problem was communication as English was a second language to both parties. How I wished the EVA staff was more professional. Instead of being overbearing and raising her voice in the hope of getting her point across, she should have discreetly pulled the couple aside and then asked another staff, possibly with better communication skills and more empathy than her, to sort the matter with the passengers, who were visibly humiliated in front of so many passengers in the queue. Incidents like this make me really angry. The flight back was excellent. New Boeing 777-300ER. Decent warm meals albeit with minuscule serving of drinks. Five-star IFE. Skilled and attentive flight attendants. (I mentioned in my first review that they needed to hone their soft skills though.) The only negative was the inability of the flight attendants to handle some of the passengers, who were part of a tour group. During boarding, some of them were in near stampede to get available overhead bins as others barked instructions to members of their group. Others were completely oblivious to their invading the personal space of other passengers while lining up for the washroom. I was seated at 69C which was three rows from the last row in the rear. Beware of that aisle seat. It did not have a restful 10-hour flight given the constant flux and occasional chatter of people going to the washrooms. In spite of the negatives some of which were beyond the airline's control, EVA represents a good value for the money. I will fly EVA again given its competitive ticket price.",good value for money
EVA Air,"Vancouver to Cebu via Taipei. My first time to try EVA, which is unfamiliar to me.  I did an internet search and was pleasantly surprised to know that EVA has a 5-star rating. That set the tenor of my expectation when I flew in early January 2018. Arrived at YVR airport 4 hours prior to my flight and the lineup was already building up at the counter assigned to EVA. I waited only 20 minutes from the time the staff started the check-in process. I paid for window seats when I bought my return ticket from Flight Hub only to be told that EVA does not honour such arrangement with Flight Hub. The staff told me that this was an ongoing problem. (It is incredibly hard dealing with Flight Hub and getting back what I paid for the window seats for the 4 sectors.)  My main carry-on was 7 kg. I thought my smaller bag with my laptop, tablet, chargers, etc. would be okay given what the online baggage guidelines say. Was wrong and asked to transfer some of my stuff to one of my checked-ins, which was below the limit. In fairness to EVA, the staff were very courteous. Boarding was organized and uneventful. The flight was fully booked. The Boeing 777-ER300 was either brand new or newly refitted. I was assigned to a middle seat next (46J) to the emergency exit. Acres of legroom but no overhead bin for my bags. The meals were decent but drinks were consistently served in minuscule volume compared to what I am used to with North American airlines. The washrooms must have been cleaned and restocked at least twice during the 13-hour flight to Taipei.  In-flight entertainment was top notch featuring the latest Hollywood offerings. 5 stars! In-flight service would have given 5 stars too but I cannot. The cabin staff were efficient albeit in a cold manner. They need to beef up their soft skills and learn the art of making passengers feel genuinely welcome.  Smile and say welcome in a way that jives with your non-verbal cues. Gently take the bag of someone who is struggling to find space in the overhead bin instead of brusquely grabbing the bag without saying anything or making eye contact to assure the passenger you are there to help. Transit in Taipei was smooth and quick. We changed to an A321 for the flight to Cebu. The boarding gate was changed the last minute. I had difficulty understanding the instructions over the PA. A few other non-Chinese passengers had the same challenge. I got to Cebu in one piece after a three-hour flight. Thanks to EVA Air. Overall, it was a very good flying experience.",a very good flying experience
EVA Air,London to Bangkok. Travelling with 2 passengers with special needs and wouldn’t let us all sit together. Due I’m told by Heathrow ground staff to odd system of spitting cabin seat allocation between Bangkok to Taipei leg and Bangkok to London leg. Extremely disappointing start to holiday. No help from twitter feed and no confidence they’ll fix for return journey. Hence low overall score and value for money. Food and inflight service good.,inflight service good
EVA Air,"Flew A321 from Taipei to Incheon. Overall a good flight! I received an email before the flight to say that I'd been automatically checked-in, though when I arrived at the airport, I still needed to go to a machine to print my boarding pass, then line up to drop off my bag and answer the question about the contents of my luggage etc. Therefore I really wonder what on earth is the point of auto check-in — it seems pretty much redundant. Plane was clean and comfortable and in good condition. We waited over an hour on the tarmac before taking off from Taipei, seemingly due to heavy traffic at the airport, but the crew gave little information about this, which was a little frustrating. I got a gluten-free meal, which was really tasty - much better than the one on the flight to Taiwan from Korea. The seats were comfortable and spacious enough, although there is no personal entertainment — this is a little disappointing for an otherwise high-quality, full-service airline. Once we finally took off, the crew were friendly and efficient and responded efficiently to my requests for extra drinks. There is some need for the crews, captain included, to improve their English pronunciation ability.",seats were comfortable and spacious
EVA Air,"Flew A321 from Incheon to Kaohsiung. Overall a good flight. I got a gluten-free meal, which, as is mostly the case, was a bit tasteless, but okay. The meal service felt a little more rushed than it need to be. The seat seats were comfortable and spacious enough, although there is no personal entertainment — this is a little disappointing for an otherwise high-quality, full-service airline. The seat-back tables are quite small and slippery, with an ineffective drinks storage spot, also the flight was a bit turbulent, so the crew were only able to hand out tiny amounts of drinks; lest they slide off the tables, I guess. Therefore if you are thirsty you need to keep asking for refills. Plane landed ahead of schedule. Crew were friendly and efficient although there is a lot of room for improvement with English — especially pronunciation.",Overall a good flight
EVA Air,"Another faultless flight with EVA from Bangkok to London Heathrow. Great staff, friendly and helpful. The seat is one of the best business class products around with comfortable bed, good TV and plenty of storage. Although the food is primarily Asian there are Western options, and more is available to pre-order. After trying numerous other carriers to the Far East I have yet to find one that matches EVA for a consistently good product and service.",Another faultless flight
EVA Air,"EVA Air is the cheapest premium economy for this journey from London to Bangkok and it seems that myself and a lot of other people booked it thinking that we were getting a bargain on a top 5 airline. What a surprise we had. The seats are good, the boarding was organized, and those were the best points. The food was amazingly rubbish. The main meal was three small pieces of chicken thigh, with a small potion of rice and veg, the breakfast was an omelette with half a sausage! Would it have been a big deal to give us a full sausage each! I have had much better meals on both Thai and Singapore economy, flying the same route. So for the extra £400 on top of the economy fare, I got a small bag with eye mask, toothbrush and paste etc, a slightly wider seat, a crowded cabin and boring meals. And the economy section was less crowded. If economy is less crowded on my return trip, I'll ask to be downgraded from premium to standard economy. I fail to understand why this airline is rated so highly, I found Thai and Singapore to be of much better quality.",a crowded cabin and boring meals
EVA Air,"London Heathrow to Bangkok. I fly regularly to SE Asia but hadn't used EVA for some time, preferring instead services and deals with Emirates, Qatar and - occasionally - Thai. However, a great price came up that included a return Bangkok Airways return flight between Bangkok and Samui - and I was really very impressed. The new 1-2-1 herringbone layout in EVA business is a significant improvement and makes the cabin much calmer and more relaxing. It is the crew, however, for which I must reserve the most fulsome praise. On this flight (and indeed on my return) they were utterly delightful - efficient, friendly, attentive and with lovely personalized service. Check-in at Heathrow was effortless, the Air Canada lounge in terminal 2 was lovely and tranquil (I think that had much to do with the late evening departure of my flight) and boarding was equally as easy. The food on EVA is not as good, in my experience, as that of Emirates or Qatar, but the crew seemed to be endlessly on-hand (not disappearing mid-flight as with some carriers) with drinks and the offer of snacks. I'm not a fan of the daylight return flight from Bangkok but, at the right price, I would use EVA again without hesitation.",I was really very impressed
EVA Air,"Houston to Bangkok via Taipei. An excellent flight overall. Aircraft interior appeared fairly new and was in good condition. The 1x2x1 seat layout offers sufficient privacy. Flight crew gets extra points for keeping the bathrooms clean and tidy throughout the flights. Many airlines simply ignore this very important function. Meals were actually some of the highest quality we have experienced on all 5 star carriers. Only 2 complaints: a) Inferior entertainment offerings, which are the least favorite of all 5 star airlines. EVA definitely needs to improve its entertainment. Very disappointing. Ground service is sloppy and unprofessional. Business class passengers are offered zero boarding benefits. Boarding is just one massive crowd push with little or no direction from ground staff. EVA's boarding in Taipei is the least professional of any 5 Star airline we have flown and it was no better in Bangkok or Houston.",excellent flight overall
EVA Air,"I heard great things about EVA so I was really excited to fly with them. This was a return flight from Vancouver to Bangkok with a 6 hour layover in Taipei. I was impressed with the menu, which included two options, Asian meal or continental/western meal. Livery was also excellent. While they don't give every passenger in economy slippers, toothbrushes and other amenities, the flight attendants will give you one if you request them. The food was so-so. I thought it was weird that their Asian option included a dinner roll. It would have been nice if they picked an Asian side instead. Inflight entertainment was limited. They have a lot more options for Chinese passengers but if you are not familiar with Chinese movie stars or singers, you are stuck with the weird selection of Western music. The headsets were terrible I could not hear the crew announcements so I switched to my iphone earbuds. I was frustrated with the outbound trip because I picked a seat just behind the engines and this particular plane had really loud engines. Their seat diagram online did not show the location of the wings so I did not realize I picked a seat behind the engines.  The return trip was much better. At the check-in counter, I requested for a different seat once I found out I was sitting behind the engines again! The check in person was very helpful but could not find me a better seat since it's the day of the flight and good seats are gone. Same food and limited options for movies and music. I had high expectations for EVA but I was not impressed.",plane had really loud engines
EVA Air,"Flew EVA Air Incheon - Paris CDG via Taipei Taoyuan, Feb 2018, Business Class. EVA uses Asiana Business lounge in ICN, they have expanded but their lounge is a little overcrowded. Might have had something to do with the holidays. ICN-CDG flight was very comfortable, boarding and seating fast and easy, service very courteous. A little heavy on the Hello Kitty livery but no big deal. Flight was comfortable, a little turbulence but nothing serious. Food choices very good, flight attendants were very accommodating when I wanted to change the meal time. Return flight 7 days later CDG-ICN was also ok, seats comfortable, Wifi service very good over Europe but spotty over the pole. Boarding on final leg very good, overall excellent service with regards to flight attendants, courtesy, food, boarding, seat comfort, IFE could have a bit more variety in music and movies. Would easily fly EVA Air again.",service very courteous
EVA Air,"EVA air is very competitive for the route from Hong Kong to Taipei. I choose EVA is mainly because I want to experience it. The ground service in Hong Kong and infight service are very great. All in all , it deserves a 5 star airline.",deserves a 5 star airline
EVA Air,"New York JFK to Manila via Taipei. The airline crew is courteous and helpful. Food is delicious and in flight entertainment is good. But seats are uncomfortable, space is narrow. Good value of money and the only airline that provide free shuttle to their passengers which is great help. I will definitely fly with Eva Air again. One thing that I'm not satisfied is that the employee in Manila gave me different seat from Manila to Taipei while I pay window seat for my flight which I didn't notice when he gave me my boarding pass because I'm confident that since I pay for seat selection they will gave me the reserved seat that I choose when I purchased my ticket.",crew is courteous and helpful
EVA Air,"Hong Kong to Toronto via Taipei. EVA Air has one of the best service! They are ready to help for whatever related problem you have. The staff may not have the best knowledge but they will find out whatever it is needed for the passenger. Had a 15hour flight delay from my flight back to HK from NY. There are no extras given to passengers but they make food vouchers available when needed. There is never a need to argue, they are already doing the best they can before you even ask.",has one of the best service!
EVA Air,"Paris to Bangkok via Taipei. Good comfy seats in economy, on the way up to Bangkok had the pleasure of having a Hello Kitty plane, friendly cabin crew, food good. The entertainment system could be upgraded lots of old film and music not realy up to date. Otherwise good airline keep in mind Taipei  airport is a busy airport if you don't have lot of time go quickly trough boarding gates again.",friendly cabin crew
EVA Air,"Toronto to Brisbane via Taipei. The flight from Toronto to Taipei was 15h 45m in the air, but I wasn't uncomfortable at all. I'm not excessively tall (180cm), but big enough that I fill in the seat and can use every bit of legroom I can get. On this particular flight, legroom was not an issue for me at all and even the width of the seat was plenty for me. Being a new plane we had the wide(r) touch-screen entertainment system and the selection of movies and television shows was adequate. Even tried out a couple of the games and they were entertaining enough to pass some time. Food was hit-and-miss. On the flight to Toronto they served a pesto chicken pasta that was actually really delicious. Other meals were good or just okay. There was always something on the tray to my liking though. Service was good as well, no issues to report. The best part is that I was comfortable enough to sleep the majority of the 15+ hour flight. Comparatively, the next leg was on a much older plane (also EVA) and the comfort of the seats and the age of the entertainment system certainly fell compared to the flight prior. EVA was the cheapest option I could find for the busiest time of the year and I got my money's worth and more. I will definitely look at them first for my next trip. All rating selections are for my cumulative 4 flights from BNE to YYZ and return.",got my money's worth and more
EVA Air,"This was the second flight segment for my return trip to Vancouver. The shorter BKK to TPE flight was flawless and I was eager to see how the longer, 10 hour, flight would play out. I was not disappointed, in the least! I've never encountered such kind and engaged flight crew members. The boarding process was calm and organized and I was met with a genuine smile at each point. I was shown to my Royal Laurel seat which offered great privacy and comfort. Soon (after the glass of Veuve Clicquot champagne and hot towel on a tray), I was presented with comfortable pajamas, slippers, and a hard shell Rimowa amenity kit. Food and beverage choices were ample and very well presented. My only suggestion would be to expand the IFE range of selections. The highlight for me, however, comes back to the absolutely wonderful cabin crew. The five star rating is truly well deserved!","was not disappointed, in the least"
EVA Air,"First time flying on EVA Air. Flew Kuala Lumpur to Los Angeles via Taipei. Both the B777 and A330 aircrafts were impressive. Clean and comfortable. Connection was seamless in Taipei. Smiling and attentive crew members. Food choices could be improved (eg chicken/beef & chicken/pork combos instead of beef/pork combo). Overall, it was a pleasant journey altogether.",Smiling and attentive crew members
EVA Air,"San Francisco to Kuala Lumpur via Taipei. Their new slimline seats in the Boeing 777 are very narrow and uncomfortable in the row where you can attach a bassinet. Your shoulders and arms will hurt unless you raise the arm rest. They also screwed up and didn't get my wife's seafood meal on one of the legs of the flight. Other than that, pretty good overall.",seats narrow and uncomfortable
EVA Air,"San Francisco to Taipei. So far this is the best economy experience on an airline. Paying a bit more for the elite or premium class was definitely worth the $400 extra for the modern seating with noticeable improvements in width, legroom and recline (including a footrest) They also made sure it was a special cabin with check-in, boarding, screen dividers, amenity kits, bottled water, etc.Touchscreens that can be moved to accommodate the recline of the seat in front of you were perfect (but selection to watch was terrible) and staff was the friendliest and most professional for economy. Staff spoke perfect English and came around frequently with service items to ensure comfort including allowing passengers to take 2 snacks, etc. When my neighbor started crying from ear pain on the descent, staff were caring and helpful. Much appreciated was staff also keeping passengers in line-like telling them to sit down when we are 10 minutes from landing! Only downside was the food-main dishes were unappetizing, but I could at least eat the fresh fruit which was ripe, the roll and fresh vegetables.",best economy experience
EVA Air,"Los Angeles to Taipei. Excellent, a true 5-star airline. Service flawless, the cabin was clean and food was awesome. I've flown EVA Air just twice. This time it's a LAX-TPE round trip in its Boeing 777 business class. The seat is a 1-2-1 herringbone configuration that provides individual isle access with good privacy.  The food tasted fresh, presentation was great. After a nice sleep, I got hungry in midflight, so I asked for some instant noodle. I was expecting it in a Styrofoam cup or bowl.  On the return trip, in midflight I asked for some snacks and coffee. Again it was just wonderful Once the meal service was over and the lights went off, little twinkle stars show up on the ceiling. It's a nice touch. My only complaint is the monitor 15.6 size is smaller compared to some airlines. I didn't watch too many movies because I had nice sleep in both trips.",Service flawless
EVA Air,"Excellent, a true 5-star airline. Service was flawless, the cabin was exceptionally clean and food was excellent. I've flown EVA Air just twice. This time it's a Los Angeles - Taipei round trip on its Boeing 777 business class. The seat is a 1-2-1 reverse herringbone configuration that provides individual aisle access with good privacy. The 5-course meal was delivered as if there is a traditional kitchen on board. The food tasted fresh, the presentation was great. But I'm sure too many people are praising their meals, so I'll skip that review. After a nice sleep, I got hungry in midflight, so I asked for some instant noodle. I was expecting it in a Styrofoam cup or bowl. See the picture how it was presented. And it still tasted great! On the return trip, in midflight I asked for some snacks and coffee. Again it was just wonderful. Once the meal service was over and the lights went off, little twinkle stars show up on the ceiling. It's a nice touch. To nitpick, my only complaint is the monitor is kind of old and the 15.6 size is smaller comparing to other airlines' new equipment. But that did not bother me at all. I didn't watch too many movies because I had nice sleep in both trips.",Service was flawless
EVA Air,"Houston to Taipei. Fantastic trip. I had really great service provided from the EVA Air IAH (Houston) Airport. I rarely write reviews but I thought I had to make an exception for this time because I was having a disaster in terms of planning and the EVA ground crew helped me not only find all the documentation I needed but made sure I got on the flight in time to make my trip to Taipei. I’ve taken EVA Air a few times and most have gone without any hiccups. This time when I was running late, the IAH team made sure to get me over to the right gate in time by speeding up the processing time and literally walking me there. Will fly with EVA again.",I had really great service
EVA Air,"London to Bangkok return with EVA Air. Right from the start the quality of the staff both in the lounge and the aircraft were first class. On boarding the flight we were welcomed by the crew and were given every assistance with our hand luggage and then assisted into our seats. (5D and 5G). Given a welcome drink and all the seating controls fully explained. Given pyjamas for the night flight. There were 6 crew assigned to our area and all through the flight they were only to happy to help. Food and drink supplied throughout the flight was first class and given when asked for. On the return flight home the crew were also first class. I am 6'2 tall and the seat was great, could fully lie down and sleep throughout the flight and very comfortable. Definitely would recommend this airline if flying to Thailand.",Definitely recommend this airline
EVA Air,"I was impressed by the airlines efficiency, starting from Houston IAH airport at check-in and further on the airport. They opened the check-in about 4 hours before the flight and in about 20 minutes since arriving at the airport I was up in the lounge, having checked in, passed immigration and security checks. The flight attendants did a very good job during the flights on both legs, it seems they take their job very seriously. Checking the passengers, baggage compartments, emergency exits was done several time by the flight attendants as a matter of safety (more times than I've seen with other airlines). During the flight they wandered around serving refreshment drinks and sandwiches and since I had trouble sleeping, I've seen them a lot. The seats were comfortable in economy on both flights and I was actually expecting worse conditions after reading some reviews before the flight. The seats were indeed suitable, especially since I'm a bit overweight. There was wifi on board both flights however I did not use it. The entertainment system did not have as many choices as on other airlines, but the fact that I did not see any advertising made everything a pleasant experience. The airport in Taipei was a bit crowded, but the lounge was nice, clean, properly supplied and overall the experience was very good.",flight attendants did a very good job
EVA Air,Bangkok to Taipei. This was my returning flight with EVA Air. The service on this flight was even better than the incoming flight. The cabin crew introduce their new red wine to me and explain the taste of it.  Also the meal and desert was also really nice. The cabin crew were all really kind and did every details to the best. I would highly recommend to fly with EVA Air.,I would highly recommend
EVA Air,"Taipei to Bangkok on business class. The meal service was really nice. Also the cabin crew delivered a very nice and professional service. The cabin crew of EVA Air really care about the passengers' needs and feeling. They really stands on passengers' shoes to deliver their fantastic service. The facilities in their 777-300ER was also really nice, big screen with nice IFE system. I am really happy that I take EVA Air's flight.",service was really nice
EVA Air,"Toronto to Taipei. Where to commence this critique of my first experience with Eva Air. Spoiler Alert: Do not even think of using this airline. At the airport they insist on checking the credit card that you used to purchase the ticket initially. Never mind that the ticket was purchased 10 months ago and the credit card may have expired or have been renewed and therefore no longer exists. And why? Oh, it because of potential fraud – so lets get this right – ticket was bought 10 months ago, if there was any fraud involved, it would have been detected by now. Oh and by the way the ticket is in the same name as the credit card holder who paid it 10 months ago. Tried to check in on-line (within 24 hours) – won’t let you. So, a call is placed to reservation hotline (love the word) – no answer – had to hang up after 2 hours waiting for an answer. It's check in time at the airport now. At the counter, they insist on weighing hand luggage! If over 5 kilos, not allowed. So what to do? Answer from the male supervisor – take it home and re-pack! Really? Go home, re-pack and come back even though 3 kilos over the weight? Sign luggage waivers – they make you sign waivers for the luggage – never ever encountered this before Over heard from adjacent counter: Lady had purchased ticket 12 months ago – was told flight was full and she couldn’t get a seat. At the gate, the topic de jour was Filipinos complaining about Eva Air and their handling of their customers. Moral of this story: Travel Eva Air at your peril, unless you want to face humiliation, incredibly poor service and treated like dirt! There are much better alternatives out there.",better alternatives out there
EVA Air,"London Heathrow to Taipei return via Bangkok. Overall it’s one of the best business class products I have experienced. Check in service in London and Taipei was great. Very efficient and personal, boarding was quick and smooth. The crew worked really hard to cater for needs of the passengers. They were smiley and worked non stop. They walked around the cabin to ask if any more drink/food is needed. Food and drink very high quality of wines (vintage champagne) and food (you can select online in advance) were provided. The menu, drink list, table cloths were  beautifully designed. Amenities: proper duvet, pillow, pyjama and slippers, Rimowa amenity kit and noise cancellation ear phone provided. Seat is herringbone style and very comfortable and has great privacy. Cleanliness: despite not being the brand new airplanes, it was well maintained. Toilets were kept in a good condition Taipei airport – being the home base of EVA, the terminal 2 is over crowded in the departure hall. It was a long queue for security and passport control and there was no designated lane for business class passengers. I used the Infinity lounge at Taipei. It was not very inviting and the selection of drink and food was poor. Very disappointing for a home base lounge. The lounge in Bangkok, on the other way, was very calm and clean. IFE: very limited choice of movie, TV, music. It’s below what other major airlines are offering.",crew worked really hard
EVA Air,"Taipei to Toronto. We flew EVA home from Asia in business class and this was the first time we had used them. Our routing was Taipei to Toronto a 13 hours plus flight. The Boeing 777 aircraft looked super clean and fresh. Even during mid flight the galley area where the lavatory was situated was super spotless and tidy. I loved the business class configuration; it is the best I have used so far. Everything was designed to maximize passenger comfort and space. The details of the seat were well thought out with lots of space and shelves to hold your stuff. The seat was the most comfortable I have experienced for sleep - wider and lie flat surface longer than any other so far. The pillow was plush and large and the blanket thick and warm. PJs and a thin mattress also available if desired. I had no trouble sleeping well on our over night flight, despite lots of turbulence. The food service included dinner and a breakfast just before arrival. I chose Chinese style cuisine for both and they were delicious. Food presentation was excellent. EVA paid attention to little details, for example, chopstick and spoon holders were an elegant touch. The young ladies / FA did amazing job. They worked super hard and served with a smile despite same shift for 14 hours. The amenity kit was placed in a Rimowa silver container - very nice. Two lavatories up front, one bigger than the other with wood floors and hand cloth towels to wash our face and paper cups to brush our teeth, again great attention to customer service. All in all very impressive airline and my best flight to date. Wish I can use EVA all the time.",very impressive airline
EVA Air,"Houston to Manila with a very tight change in Taipei. Airline is very organized and flight was not a problem. The flight crew was very attentive and when I wasn’t eating wanting to make sure I was happy with the food. In truth, I was exhausted and they gave me extra blankets and pillows to make sure I was comfortable on a 13.5 hour flight from Taipei. While in flight movies are limited and WiFi was spotty, it was a pleasant experience thanks to the flight crew",it was a pleasant experience
EVA Air,"This is the first time we flew EVA Air from Singapore to Taipei (return). Good expectation as I have read many good reviews about them. Pros: cabin service is generally good. Excellent safety record and great pilot skill on landing. Cons: On both flights, the departure time was delayed. Food was awful - I did not finish the noodles. Online movies very limited. on return trip, the AC was too cold.",departure time was delayed
EVA Air,"Taipei to Chicago. Excellent in every way except for their airport lounges. Compared with business class on Lufthansa (recently BOS-MUC), Swiss (BOS-ZRH), UA (EWR-MUC), this is a new standard. Comfortable aircraft, excellent crew and service, superb food quality and presentation. The lounge at ORD is contracted with KLM/Delta, nothing to be proud of. The business lounge in Taipei: as if somebody tried to recreate a scifi ambiance from a 1960's movie, weird and not too inviting. Plenty of space but probably designed by computers, with no consideration for coziness or ambiance , not to mention comfort. Lufthansa Senator or HON lounge in Munich or KLM in Amsterdam, those are pretty high up on my list.",excellent crew and service
EVA Air,EVA business class seats on regional flights are 2x2x2 per row. It was an inconvenience while I was taking a window seat. I had to climb over my neighbour to move out of my seat. I felt less privacy than the Boeing 777 aircraft.,A330 has less privacy than the B777
EVA Air,New York to Bangkok via Taipei. Great airline experience. The economy seats were a good size in the 3-3-3 configuration on a Boeing 777 with good entertainment options on the IFE unit. Food was solid and the staff was great. Would fly again; top choice for heading to most Asian countries via Taiwan.,Great airline experience
EVA Air,"Ho Chi Minh to Seattle via Taipei. This ground crew went above and beyond to help me in Ho Chi Minh City. My hopper flight was delayed due to thunderstorms and tardiness. I called the ticket counter from Nha Trang, VN and they checked me in and let me know I could still board if within 40 minutes of my flight. My flight (another airline) landed at 0102. We were scheduled to leave at 0150. When I ran up to the ticket counter, I had already been checked in and tickets printed and waiting for me. I had ditched my bag just to make my international flight. They offered to retrieve it out of the domestic terminal. They were very kind and went way above and beyond what was ever expected of them. It was because of the ground crew staff in Ho Chi Minh city that I made my flight with bag in hand that I never dreamed of making. Thank you ground staff.",went above and beyond
EVA Air,"I was on vacation and flew back to Toronto with EVA, the service at SGN was great. Onboard the SGN-TPE flight was very comfortable and the IFE was excellent, although I wish they had more K-Pop selections. The lavatories were very clean and the flight attendants were very kind. Connecting to Toronto in Taipei was very easy, connecting was just a few steps away from the gate. The TPE-YYZ flight was as comfortable as the first, and sleeping in economy on EVA is quite fine. The food on both flights was excellent. Overall, flying with EVA is great. I often fly EVA Air when going to SGN because the fares are cheap and the service is excellent.",flight was very comfortable
EVA Air,"This was my first time flying with EVA flying from New York JFK to Hong Kong via Taipei. Everyone whom I asked about EVA had good things to say about it. Its service was very good. Its meals ranged from good to mediocre. (The mediocre meal was served on the Taipei-Hong Kong leg that lasted under two hours, so one could say that a complimentary meal on a short haul flight was better than nothing or even generous). IFE on the New York-Taipei leg was adequate, although I'd have liked to see more recent movies. My seat, however, could have been less uncomfortable had it been able to recline more.",service was very good
EVA Air,"Hong Kong to Vienna return via Taipei in June 2017. EVA Air is probably the best Asian airline I've ever flown. Their ground service in Hong Kong and Vienna were impeccable. It was no hassle to check-in my slightly overweight backpack from Vienna to Taipei (I had a one day layover) instead of tagging it all the way to Hong Kong. Also, they know how to handle delays well - my outbound flight from Hong Kong to Taipei was delayed due to bad weather but the EVA Air staff were able to handle the situation by providing refreshments before boarding. Service on board is probably on par with that of a 5-star restaurant or hotel on the ground. No complaints, lots of smiles on the faces of the crew, great attention and care, and a very friendly attitude to the passengers. The food on board all my flights was delicious and I really appreciate their regular hot coffee/tea service on the long-haul sectors of my ticket. Decent movie selection on board as well, and the seats on the 777s were really comfortable for the transcontinental flights. If you're hungry, you can grab a snack from the counter at galleys or ask the cabin crew for help. WiFi was a bit expensive though so I didn't purchase any of their plans. All in all EVA Air was definitely great value for money considering the price I paid for my ticket. Can't wait to fly them again soon!",probably the best Asian airline
EVA Air,Shanghai to San Francisco via Taipei. I generally have a very positive feedback from EVA air flight. I originally purchased an Economy ticket PVG-TPE-SFO and return but due to overbooking and my status with another StarAlliance airline I was twice upgraded to Premium Economy on the short leg between Shanghai and Taipeh. On my way to San Francisco the seats in economy class are small as they configure 10 abreast on the B777 for that flight. The legroom was though good enough for me catching some sleep on the outward journey. On the way back I managed to upgrade to EVA business class via award points and I got a fairly good deal for doing so. The service on that leg was very attentive. The seat was excellent and I managed to get a good sleep on the return flight so I arrived fresh and agile back in Shanghai.,a very positive feedback
EVA Air,"Toronto to Hong Kong via Taipei with my family of four. The business lounge was under renovation so we were served at a temporary lounge which was not any impressive. But as soon as we board, the services and the smiling faces of the attendants made up for the bad lounges. Our seats were in the middle with the 1x2x1 arrangement so none of us has window seats which would be what I will travel in the future. We were handed a small Rimova amenity kit full of things that we would need on the air. Pyjamas given to each passenger and it was very comfortable. Dinner was excellent with very good French wine. Snacks choices were instant noodles, Singapore noodles or hamburger. I have scrambled eggs for breakfast. The washroom was clean after every use. I love their facial mist. Flight attendants checked me out constantly. A nice touch was they offer to make the bed for us. They use some kind of quilt sheet to make it more comfortable to sleep. the headset provided was a very good quality one. It was good to wear for a long time. I will fly Eva in a heart beat. Both legs were perfectly on time. I was also impressed with check in area. It was fast and efficient. During connection, we used the lounge by Eva Air, and was able to use the shower and it was equipped with all the necessary toiletries.",smiling faces of the attendants
EVA Air,"Bangkok to London. What a revelation this airline was on my trip last week! Having used British Airways and Thai Airways for my flights to UK and back, I was persuaded by my travel agent to try EVA business class, and I will be back. Fabulous lounge at BKK airport that is so much better than Thai Airways offers. Boeing 777 seats in 1x2x1 layout and very comfortable - better than the others. Food was really nice, fabulous pork dish that was memorable. Crew service was impeccable and I now understand why this is a 5 star airline. Great airline, great service.",this is a 5 star airline
EVA Air,"Amsterdam to Manila via Bangkok / Taipei. My first trip outside the Philippines was memorable and awesome due to the extreme comfort I received from using EVA Air as my airline. The food was remarkable for my pre-order meals. The in-flight entertainment is up to date and it allowed to catch up on the movies that I missed in cinemas. The crew, both on the ground and in flight are attentive to the needs of the passengers. I am quite fascinated that the check-in crew because they also ensured that I would not encounter any conflict during my return flight by inspecting if my visa is valid and counterchecked it with management and immigration. It was a smooth trip, even if I had long transits in Bangkok and Taipei, which allowed me to have additional trips. EVA Air is indeed a 5 star airline. I can't wait to find another good deal for my trip to London this coming August.",indeed a 5 star airline
EVA Air,"Taipei Taoyuan airport has Hello Kitty e-check in counter, it's very cute. A delay for more than one hour, ground staff offers cookies and drinks (apple juice or water). Boeing 777-300 seats are comfortable for Premium Economy class. The flight is very short but offers a cake and cup of tea/coffee. Eva Air is worth 5 star rating.",is worth 5 star rating
EVA Air,"This was a rather pleasant flight from Los Angeles to Taipei on EVA Air. The service on EVA Air is always amazing, and this flight was no exception. The flight attendants were all friendly and attentive. The entertainment was pretty normal for a long haul. The seats were okay and the aircraft was very clean. We were on a new Boeing 777-300ER so it was super clean. The first meal was good, but the second meal tasted awful. (EVA air's catering is its weak spot). Overall, this was a pleasant experience and I will fly with EVA Air again.",a pleasant experience
EVA Air,"Toronto to Bangkok via Taipei. The Toronto to Taipei flight was superb; super clean aircraft, pleasant and attentive FAs, good and tasty food, always clean bathrooms. Taipei to Bangkok leg had no Premium Economy and was less pleasant. The aircraft was older too, and not the cleanest and the plane crowded. Otherwise it was ok. Bangkok to Taipei on return was similar to Taipei to Bangkok but I was annoyed that the pre-booked Economy window seat had been given to someone else and I was put in a seat in the dreaded centre area (2-4-2 configuration). The Taipei to Toronto flight was very good but it was crowded in Elite Class so was less pleasant than Toronto to Taipei. This is a good airline overall and I will definitely choose EVA Air again.",definitely choose EVA Air again
EVA Air,"Taipei Songshan to Tokyo Haneda on board A330 Hello Kitty livery. Cute interior and music. Even toilet papers are Hello Kitty-related. Delicious in-flight fruit meal (requested beforehand). Cabin super clean with well-behaved passengers. All in all, a very pleasant economy class experience.",very pleasant economy class
EVA Air,"Paris to Taipei. Excellent experience on this first EVA Air flight. Nice ground service, fast and efficient. Access to Star Alliance lounge in Paris, which is nice, cosy and with fine food and beverages. Priority boarding quick. In flight experience was great, starting with a top quality service from attendants. Seat is confortable. Mattress and pajamas are nice touches. Toiletries bag one of the best I ever had. Entertainment could have a larger and better selection of movies. Food excellent, wines good. A remarkable service quality overall that makes me looking forward to my next EVA Air trip. Also fly return, with same if not better experience, so consistency another plus from EVA Air.",remarkable service quality
EVA Air,"Los Angeles to Taipei. I fly on EVA Air quite frequently. The level of service has always been good and consistent, the aircrafts have always been clean and comfortable, and it's ground staff are usually helpful and courteous, most of the time. At LAX, I am not sure if they outsourced the check in counter service to someone else (they wear different colours and type of uniform from the regular green EVA Air uniform), but the level and quality of service have been inconsistent, ranging from very friendly and personal, to the occasional rude. For service in the air, the aircaraft is good and clean, everything without problems, but the amenities and decor are outdated and would help with some updates. The worst part about flying with EVA, which was reaffirmed by this flight, is its food service. It is bland, it is boring.",food service is bland
EVA Air,"Bangkok to New York via Taipei. This was my first time traveling to Asia or using an Asian airline. This was by far one of the best airlines I've ever flown. The aircraft were so clean, and the hospitality on the flight was amazing. We had two meals, 3 snacks and endless beverages. The seats in economy weren't the most spacious I've had but it was perfect for me, and the seats are comfortable and the touch screen tv is great for a 16 hour flight. I will be flying with them again for sure.",one of the best airlines
EVA Air,"Toronto to Taipei with EVA Air. The comfort of the Business Class cabin and quality of onboard service made this very long flight (15 hours) acceptable and pleasant. The lie-flat seats are very comfortable, pillow, mattress and pajama are supplied so that a good sleep is possible. Another advantage is that the cabin is divided in two smaller sections, thus limiting circulation and noise. Excellent, attentive service and good food (an exception: I chose the steak which was overcooked and tasteless) for dinner and breakfast. Acceptable selection of wines for dinner. I did not use the entertainment system except for the flight information, maps section which I found interesting and precise. My complaint is the loud, looping music playing before takeoff should be avoided. Concluding, an excellent airline which I would recommend.","excellent, attentive service"
EVA Air,"New York JFK to Taipei with EVA Air. A great experience for me. Food was excellent, seats are wide, comfortable enough to stretch my legs, FA is very friendly and very attentive, English speaking. Cocktail drink was excellent. Toilet is very clean. I will fly to this airline again. Always on time.",food was excellent
EVA Air,"Bangkok to London Heathrow. EVA Air is undoubtedly an efficient and well run operation, with pleasant staff at the check-in at BKK through to a tad less pleasant flight attendants. Leg room and seats were more spacious than the average Economy class, though it does look a bit dated. Food was disappointing, though not especially bad. The selection of movies was very mediocre for long haul. Despite everything being perfectly reasonable about the flight, it was one of those horrible flying experiences that left me grasping for sanity. Not really the flight attendants fault, but some particularly poor parenting to the rear of me, saw a toddler terrorize the entire flight by screaming and/or running around the cabin. This was book ended by a newly born infant adding to the cacophony at the front. It really is time to have the option that some airlines offer for long haul, such as Malaysia Airlines, of child free zones, or at very least some kind of quiet zone (or even a family only zone).",more spacious than average Economy class
EVA Air,Manila to San Francisco via Taipei. This is the second time I have flown EVA Air from the US to Manila and back. As a disabled passenger I found the airline to be extremely caring in their handling of my needs from checkin to deplane. The flight crew were all very helpful in my care during the flight and the aircraft was clean quiet and on time.,found the airline extremely caring
EVA Air,"What excellent flights from New York to Taipei return. I flew out on Christmas Day 2016 and returned on 13 January 2017. This was the first time we took EVA Air and tried out their Elite Class (premium economy). I used to take either premium economy or business with Cathay Pacific. As I was not happy with the service of CX I decided to try EVA Air which received good reviews and offered cheaper tickets. I am so glad I did! The planes were new, which made a lot of difference for air quality on a long-haul flight. The seats were much more comfortable than that of Cathay Pacific Premium Economy. They were wider and could lean back much more. There were plenty of flight attendents who responded to requests promptly and always with a smile. They also kept the toilets clean and well-supplied throughout the long flight. The food choice was excellent, and meals were tasty. The service was top-notch. All attendants were polite and attentive. I had a slight stomach problem when flying back. The nice attendant noticed that I skipped meals. She cared enough to ask me if I was feeling better and would I like a sandwich to bring home. This is the kind of service that wins hearts. Bravo EVA Air.",the service was top-notch
EVA Air,"Taipei to Seattle return in Premium Laurel (business class) on a soon-to-be-retired Boeing 747. Business class seats are not as good or private as those found in the 777s. Thoughtful, proactive staff made up for it, as did the food. The biggest drawback was the lounge used in Seattle. They use the British Airways lounge, which was a disappointment. The only food available was instant noodles or some sorry-looking sandwiches. The attendant who was supposed to be serving drinks to lounge guests was busy having a rest in the first class portion of the lounge.",proactive staff made up for it
Korean Air,"At least 4 inches more legroom in economy class than most other airlines I've flown. It makes such a big difference in terms of comfort and it's not something for which they charge more. With that much legroom, it doesn't matter if the passenger in front of you fully reclines. A lot of movie selections on the entertainment system and the food and service was good quality. However, I would recommend that if you are vegetarian that you place the meal request prior to flying because I saw two meal servings that had no non-meat options. The 14 hours of the flight went by faster than I expected.",more legroom in economy class
Korean Air,"Having flown KE several times now, I found the experience from start to finish quite predictable. Their Y product is definitely above average and surpasses most of the competition with good meals, generous leg room and great inflight customer service. There was a downside to this trip however. My seat became defective as the recline lever wouldn’t return the seat back to its upright position, but kept reclining. The steward attempted to rectify it, but the problem only repeated once I reclined after meal service. Moreover, KAL’s AVOD system isn’t my favorite as the selections are limited and feels oriented primarily for a Korean audience. All in all, it was a solid experience and I’d fly again if the price Is right.",“it was a solid experience”
Korean Air,"Really great experience.  Really good food, more legroom on average, and great flight attendants. They give you a lot of goodies for comfort on international flights. Only thing that isn’t great is their website.",Really great experience
Korean Air,"No courtesy to passengers. Flight was delayed by 4 hours so I missed my connecting flight with the same airline. Rebooked to a flight 11 hours from original flight. Asked for hotel accommodation and compensation. They said they are not responsible for the delay, so they won’t provide hotel or compensation. Assuming they’re not responsible, they should extend some courtesy or apologize and offer some comfort to passengers like me who had to wait 10 hours for my connecting flight. Rude, unapologetic. Terrible service.",No courtesy to passengers
Korean Air,"Very satisfied with the overall experience. Airfares include checked baggage, which makes the cost of flying direct only marginally more expensive than flying via a hub in continental Europe or the Middle East. Ground and in-flight service good. Food reasonably good, but how can Korean Air run out of Bibimbap? The above average legroom of 84cm in Economy is much appreciated by this 185cm tall man, so much more comfortable than Lufthansa's pathetic 79cm. But I hate reclining seats and feel they should be banned by IATA.",above average legroom
Korean Air,"Korean Air is a national flag carrier in 2023 that is still not offering WiFi for long haul routes. As a businessman this was an astronomical inconvenience as the flight was 11 hours long! Compared to airlines such as Emirates Korean Air's aircraft, interiors and quality of service is very shabby and below par. Just because it's Korean doesn't mean it's better. Their national airlines are oddly much worse than all of their other forms of public transportation.",service is very shabby
Korean Air,"This was a short one-hour flight. My original flight was delayed by an hour so I appreciated the option to opt for an earlier one at no charge. Here were the goods to this experience: check-in was easy, quick and no hassle and the A220 plane used was new and clean. The downside had to do with the boarding process as it wasn’t smooth due to the apparent lack of any procedure and order to the process. Boarding by zones and elite status was not honored despite SkyTeam rules, which KE is a founder. Also, antithetical to a routine domestic flight onboard, there was no beverage service offered likely due to some mild turbulence. In summary, it was a good flight that got me there relatively on time for me to make my connecting flight. If the price is right, I’d fly them again.",I’d fly them again
Korean Air,Five stars for service and friendliness. The check-in area and aircraft were spotless but could have used some Asian flair and colour. The best part about the airline is its inexpensive and easy-to-pay excess baggage rates.,Five stars service and friendliness

Their service was great and whatever the orders in whatever the time, it was fulfilled without any hesitation from them.",flight attendants super polite

Korean Air,"I was in Prestige Class on the Boeing 777. KE has the latest cabin product - the Apex Suites installed in their B777-300ER aircraft. The cabin configuration is 2-2-2 but every seat has aisle access. Those seated at the window can access the aisle via a narrow passage so that he doesn’t need to disturb the aisle seat passenger. As it was a red eye flight, the meal service was breakfast. I choose the Korean style breakfast of congee with condiments. The seat was wide and comfortable and fully reclining. There was a privacy divider between seats which you can use if your neighbour is a stranger. The cabin crew were efficient and friendly. At the end of the flight, the cabin manager came around to ask each Prestige Class passenger whether he enjoyed the flight. I have to point out some lapses in service which I hope that KE can address. Before landing, cabin crew did not go around to ensure that passengers lifted up the window shades. There was no way for non-Korean citizens to pre-order and pay for duty-free items for collection on board. I had to contact Sky Shop via Kakao messenger to place the order and make payment on board. I believe that this is something that KE should seriously look into as KE is an international company.  There was no welcome PA from the flight deck and no announcement on the flight plan and route unlike other airlines. It was only after landing at ICN that a cabin crew made an announcement. I believe that passengers want to hear from the flight deck.",crew were efficient and friendly
Korean Air,This is the third time I have used Korean for my transpacific flight. I just want to say that for economy class the extra inch or so of leg room they have is such a comfort compared to other airlines that ply the same route. The service is stellar and the meals are fairly good as well.,extra inch or so of leg room they have
Korean Air,"Prestige Class - that got me wondering so I called to hear what that covered and was told that it was equivalent to business, and as you can see on the Korean Air app, they have Economy, Prestige and First Class; it made sense. Wrong. The first long leg from Amsterdam to Incheon (Korea) was fine; own cabin, flat bed - 12 hours went fine. Food good and service OK. Annoying with face masks - only airline I’ve had to wear it for the last year or more. Next leg; Incheon to Auckland I was apparently downgraded to lower class. Prestige is not just prestige; you have to be sure that you have Prestige Suites all the way, because now I had a wide leaning chair, that was too narrow and too short to really rest well - and it didn’t go flat. Even worse; during the little sleep I managed to get, I was woken up twice by the stewardess, because my face mask was not positioned right? Arriving to New Zealand, tired after 30 hours of transportation, I saw that one of my bags (with priority tag on) was wrapped in plastic. Destroyed. In line with luggage service (after spending 1,5 hours in passport line), but finally got the document proving my bag was destroyed. They didn’t have a replacement like mine. Now after spending time again and again on mail, I still haven’t been compensated as they will only pay part of what my bag is worth and only against a receipt, that I don’t have. Prestige class? I don’t think so. Flying Korean Air again? I am sure I won’t.",Prestige class? I don’t think so
Korean Air,"I have to sing my praises for the ground crew at Korean Air as they really bent the rules to get me on this flight. I misjudged the travel time to the airport as ICN is super far from the city and arrived only 25 minutes prior to departure, which should of precluded the staff to allow me onboard my flight (other airlines would usually turn a blind eye). The gentlemen at the counter worked with earnest to process my documents and speedily get me through security. This positive experience continued at the boarding gate where the gate agents greeted me with a warm welcome and forgiveness despite my late arrival possibly causing the flight to be on the brink of delay. The onboard experience was predictable in a good way as I was able to rely on the consistent service that Korean Air offers irrespective of which route or plane I fly - friendly and accommodating flight attendants, good food, mediocre entertainment and time efficiency. I watched a few flicks, requested an onslaught of snacks and beverages and felt gratitude for the generosity in the ground service I received from start to finish while I looked at the dusk of day through my window seat.",rely on the consistent service
Korean Air,"Just completed a flight from LA to Incheon and it was excellent. Korean Air's strong points are its catering, leg room in economy and in flight service. The bibimbbap I had was super good and you get to enjoy it on nice Korean Air silverware. There's also Shin ramen for those who would like to enjoy a mid flight snack. I also have to give a shout out to the hardworking cabin crew that were vigilant about anticipating pax needs and for defining great hospitality. This other point may not be all that relevant for most, but I found their inflight magazine to be top notch! Not riddled with useless advertisements and boring content, but with excellent editorial pictures of destinations and useful travel tips. Conversely, this is really minor, but compared to major global carriers, the lack of entertainment choices and Wi-Fi is the airlines weak point. Still got to watch a few good flicks though. Overall, an impressive airline where the 13 hours just flew by!",an impressive airline
Korean Air,"Non existent customer service. Had flight changed with misleading email titled seat change not flight change emails. Original flight was couple of hours layover in Incheon from Auckland, changed to 23 hour layover with no accommodation given just the lounge, seated separately from my pregnant partner on the flight, worse customer service. Better look for better airlines if you’re flying around Asia, better off with Air NZ or Singapore Air.",seated separately from my pregnant partner

Korean Air,"I flew with my girlfriend with 2 carry-ons and 2 checked bags each. We expected to pay $100 for each of our second checked bags because that's what the website says. However, we found out while checking the bags that they only allow 10kg per carry on bag.  So we ended up having to pay and extra $200 each (on top of the expected $100 each) to check our second carry-on bags since they were both over 10kg. I have never had an airline weigh my carry-ons before. We gave them our credit cards and then once they checked our bags, they told us we had to go to a different counter to pick up our cards. We went there and proceeded to wait for 45 minutes while they tried to charge our cards. There was no one waiting in front of us. It literally took them 4 staff members and 45 minutes to swipe 2 credit cards. They finally told us they would waive one of the $200 charges. We gladly accepted this and left to board. I found out later that they did actually charge us that $200 even though they said they wouldn't. I called Korean Air customer support about this and they told me I had to call a different number because the flight was partnered with Delta. The woman told me the number would work even though I am international. I called that number and it didn't go through even though I used the correct country code. I know they blocked me because the same phone number still works from my girlfriend's phone. Absolutely horrible. The flight attendants woke my girlfriend up to tell her to raise her seat during meal time. They also woke me up to ask if I wanted a meal on our second flight which was only 3.5 hours. It was already half-way through the flight. Don't wake your passengers for such silly reasons. Falling asleep on a flight is already difficult enough.",never had an airline weigh my carry-ons

Korean Air,"Honolulu to Seoul-Incheon (proceeding to Hong Kong) in June 2019 - but I'm going to focus on the Honolulu - Seoul leg only for this review. This was my 7th flight on Korean Air - and all of this started on a very speedy, no-nonsense check-in process at Honolulu International Airport. The immigration checks were quick, and after a short bite, I went to the gate 2.5 hours before departure time. The boarding gate staffs were overall great - so does the cabin crews. I was welcomed in a friendly way. Upon reaching my seat, I figured out that my seat was comfortable in terms of legroom, with tons of features, but the seats were quite firm and hard, and there were several kid stickers that the cleaning crew had missed. Not a big deal for me. Throughout the entire flight, the crew kept on being friendly to me - they asked everything, even asking me if I have ever tried Bibimbap before - my 1st meal for the flight, which tasted very good. The 2nd meal of mine served before landing was beef with rice, which tasted good, but the meal presentation made me deny the 5-star rating. By this point, the crews were still very friendly but they couldn't hide the tiredness they had after the 9-hour journey (which is normal). The biggest blow of the flight was the IFE - hence why I didn't give this flight a 10/10. The IFE, for me, won in terms of responsiveness and layout, but the contents were very lacking, especially the movie section and music, with most of them being 13+ or 16+ contents, with only a few contents that were appropriate to be accessed by everyone. The saving grace of the IFE was the game sections and the onboard camera facility. Actual departure and landing time were pretty on time. In conclusion - apart from the IFE (which, according to their social media sites, has been renovated), this flight was one of the best (well, in fact, the best!) flights I've ever taken in 2019, with the crew becoming the shining stars of this flight.",flight was one of the best
Korean Air,"San Francisco to Clark via Incheon. It is really a great flight even if I only had to pay about 630$ round trip going to the Philippines. It is not a direct flight but it is more comfortable than the usual direct flight airlines that I take to go home to the Philippines. Their trays on the seats are less slippery and food trays have a stopper underneath to prevent it from sliding while eating. They serve with silver wares instead of plastic ones. Their food is really good. I had Bibimbap for dinner. Their attendants are so attentive and helpful. We travelled with our toddler and he wanted to walk around the plane but if I stop him he cries. Whenever he cries, the attendants approach us and play with my baby and walk him around the plane. Provides toys and something to keep the child busy. They never sleep throughout the flight. The bathroom has sensor faucets you don't have to touch or press anything unlike in other airlines. Their sink has automatic flush so water goes down while using it and doesn’t clog. Every time I used the bathroom, I noticed the tissue paper was folded like it was not used. They maintain their bathrooms clean and neat. Very helpful ground attendants too. I had a problem with our schedule so when I booked, I didn’t book return for my US national hubby and baby but they helped me be able to still make it to the flight and when we arrived in Korea and PI, some agents came to assist us making sure there wouldn’t be any problems at the immigration. Truly satisfied! From now on I will see to it I will fly Korean Air whenever possible.",will fly Korean Air whenever possible

Korean Air,"Kuala Lumpur to Atlanta via Seoul. On-time flight and friendly crew. All of our bags arrived safely at destination. We travelled with our 1 year old son, and with him in a carseat for the long-haul flight between KL and Seoul. The flight attendants wanted to see the airplane sticker on the seat but let us travel with it. We were in the cheap seats in the 3rd-to-last row in the back of the 747-8, in the middle. This airplane experiences a lot of yaw (side-to-side movement) during flight, so if you easily get airsick, I would not recommend sitting way in the back. There was not a ton of legroom but enough to not be uncomfortable. My butt got sore after a few hours in the seat, it is not well cushioned. You are provided with a pillow, blanket, and small amenity kit (cheap slippers and toothbrush). They provided us with 3 meals - a dinner, snack, and breakfast. The food was passable: they had chicken & rice, beef & rice, or beef & noodles on our flight. It came with a roll, dried pineapple and juice. They offer special meals for infants as well. There was no Wifi offered on this flight, and the inflight entertainment options were very few. There were some Korean movies and Western films but I only saw 2-3 movies I liked, which wasn't enough for a 12 hour flight. I've flown on the A350-900 on Delta on the way to KL, and there is a noticeable difference in the fatigue you feel afterwards. The 747-8 is large and spacious but doesn't pressurize as low as the A350, so you feel a lot more tired. Next time I'd definitely pick a 787 or A350 to go over the puddle.",On-time and friendly crew

With a virus around families need to sit together and not worry about being split up. Due to that attitude, my score reflects that.",certain tickets cannot book seats in advance

It's a decent experience after all, I had to flight late time and long transit time however can't complain anything with the service!

English speaking of the cabin crew was not sufficient for an international flight. This should be improved to let the customer better communicate with the crew.

My buttons on this dated aircraft didn't work. Even the divider between seats couldn't work because the button didn't function. The inflight entertainment is the worst I have seen.  You see many flight attendants in the business cabin, as soon as the plane took off, they shut the curtains and I rarely saw them again. Forget about beverage service - one attendant said Korean Air's policy is to inquire about sobriety with every third refill of their thimble-sized glasses. I've never seen such an absurd policy and they enforced this. My food was mediocre at best. The lounges at Incheon look like a mall food court, are totally packed, and seemed outdated.",Korean Air customer review

Upon leaving the aircraft, I sought help from crew. They were quick to refer me to the airport website and the airline website before ushering me off. Later confirmed that the airport was in possession of my wallet but needed some assistance or advice retrieving it. I called their customer service hotline which was received by an agent from the ticketing office in Malaysia, who told me that there was nothing they would do. The agent didn't have the knowledge or capacity to be of any assistance, but refused to let me speak to other staff in the airline who might have more of a clue. The airline is fine for getting from point A to B, but do not expect their staff to be of help if you need it. Also, customer support seems to ignores emails or are extremely slow at replying.",lost my wallet before boarding
Korean Air,"Seoul to Tokyo. Unprofessional and disappointing. Check in, boarding, and the beginning of the flight went smooth. The seats was comfortable with plenty of leg space. That was when things went downhill. My friends entertainment system wasn't working, and flight attendants ignore us despite us trying to get their attention. Food was bland and mushy. The head flight attendant was rushing to get food out, as she kept sighing and was rude, especially to the non Koreans. However, things started to go bad at the end of the flight. The plane had already landed and was slowly making its way to the terminal, when a little girl, about 3 years old, suddenly had to use the bathroom. The mum asked one of the flight attendant if her daughter could use the bathroom. The flight attendant went to ask her supervisor (who was the rude head flight attendant), to which she told the mum to tell her daughter to hold it. The daughter was crying, and kept saying how much it hurts (my friend who isn't Korean, but understands the language translated). The mum resorted to using a plastic bag for her daughter to uninate, in the middle of the plane. Of course, the little kid didn't want to, so the mum, desperate, just took her daughter to the bathroom. By this point, it's been 15 minutes since we've landed and was nowhere near the terminal. While I understand the importance of being in your seats while the plane is moving for our safety, certain protocol should be broken if there is a situation that arises. The head flight attendant on this flight, or at least in charge of my section, made me dislike this airline, which is disappointing as I've enjoyed this airline when I flew with them 10 days ago.",made me dislike this airline
Korean Air,"Travelled business in 2014 with Korean/KLM to Europe and good experience. This time we had 3 business class tickets from Sydney to Amsterdam partnering with KLM - who were wonderful - and return Sydney via Rome with Korean. The flight crews were attentive but cold, clinical and lacking the human touch. The lounges at Incheon are a nightmare akin to two MacDonalds in different parts of the airport but overcrowded, full of screaming badly behaved children, and with poor quality food and beverages and lack of seating. The attendants at the lounge desk were like cardboard cutouts unhelpful and arrogant when I asked for shower access. They then insulted me in Korean, not knowing I speak it! I persisted and let them know in Korean that I understood their insult. I was finally pointed to the shower section and had a hurried shower. Finally, during our holiday a family member in Sydney became gravely ill and we attempted to alter our return dates to an earlier date. This was possibly the worst aspect of having to deal with the customer service operatives of this airline. Night after night we rang them and were drip fed information about seats available on given dates waiting for a date where we could get home. At least two of the male operatives were unbelievably rude to my wife when she spoke with them, talking over the top of her and there was no audio delay to justify such rude treatment. They offered us economy seats which my wife could not take as she has a medical condition that requires a sleeper or flat bed for long haul. We didn't get anywhere with them. On 22nd October, there were 3 unallocated business tickets available back to Sydney which would have got us back 5 days earlier but when we asked about these we were told because we'd paid a different fare schedule, we could not have them unless we paid an extra 3000 per ticket in Australian dollars or Euros. We paid approximately AUD 16,500 for the original tickets. We simply couldn't afford this so we were forced to wait for the originally ticketed flight later while we dealt with our anxieties about our sick family member in Sydney. Meantime, these people flew an aircraft from Rome to Sydney with 3 empty business class seats. This may be the corporate world model for aviation now but business still depends on goodwill and Korean Air have lost our goodwill forever. We will never fly them again under any circumstance, whether for work or pleasure. They are disgraceful in their treatment of passengers in need and not worth our custom.",They insulted me in Korean
Korean Air,"Frankfurt to Sydney via Seoul. We were very pleased with Korean Air. We flew from Sydney to Europe return via Seoul. On the way over to London Korean Air put us up at the Grand Hyatt in Seoul overnight. I recommend you ask your travel agent to ask for this option as it was fantastic. On our return trip we used the new transit lounge in Terminal 2 of Incheon airport which had showers, free internet and a 'sleep zone'. The airline experience itself was good. We experienced little turbulence on all flights. The food was good though they could improve their dinners (although the Korean bibimbap option was good - we all had it twice!) Breakfasts were better than good. The cabin crew were great and helpful when we requested additional snacks, water etc, although they served enough water to keep us hydrated. The hot towels before breakfast were also appreciated. My 13 year old son said the inflight entertainment could be improved although we thought it fine. Australians do not often fly Korean Air to Europe but I would recommend you consider it as an option.",very pleased with Korean Air
Korean Air,"I flew out from Brisbane, stopover at Seoul, before continuing to my destination Japan Tokyo. During this 13 hour trip I found this airline to the most disappointing so far in my travels. I have previously flown with Cathay, Thai and Malaysia and they've been pretty good (Cathay being the best in my opinion). This airline was disappointing because they always skimp on the water levels in their cups given out every time. I'm on a plane, that is the last thing that I need - to be even more dehydrated! To those people thinking of flying you are better off buying your own bottle of water before you go. Seats were uncomfortable and at a weird angle. For that reason I highly recommend choosing a different airline for long distance travel. Seats were also quite compact and not spacious. Inflight entertainment was average and on one of the planes its remote control was stuck to the screen with a wire. What I mean by that is that everytime your window seat buddy needed to go to the toilet and needed to pass me in the aisle seat, the wire was in the way making it a clumsy design. Food was very average. Never going to fly Korean Air again.",This airline was disappointing
Korean Air,I was flying Korean Air from Jeju to Gimpo. My parents in law was catching another flight from Jeju to Shanghai with different airline. I got notified my parents in law flight got last minute cancelled due to weather issue.The Korean Air crew helped me to contact the other airline to find out what’s the issue and managed to reach my parents in law. The crew even lets us to cancel the existing flight back to gimpo so we can reunite with my parents in law outside the boarding area. I would like to thank you the Korean Air and the crew for your sincere help. I truly appreciate all their effort so we can settle our parents in law.,appreciate all their effort
Korean Air,"Tel Aviv to Seoul. Have flown this year with KE 3 times now. Our last flight with KE in August was the best. We are a family of 3 (baby 1 year old). Cabin crew was so nice and cared for us throughout the flight. We sat in the 2nd row of economy on one flight. I asked for cabin crew for something to drink which they said they have back in the galley (i told never mind and asked for something else). After finishing providing meals for others the staff came back especially with my drink. Check in was super fast on all flight, boarding on time, seats comfortable (I am a big guy) food was ok, movie selection changed on the 2 flights (so i had full new options to watch on both ways), flights on time.",seats comfortable
Korean Air,"Honolulu to Singapore via Seoul. Delta put me on Korean Air as a codeshare flight. I last flew with Korean Air in 2010, and my impression after flying with them at that time was that it was fantastic, far better than most other airlines. Now, that impression is gone. Leg room was very good, entertainment ok although the range of movies is far more limited than Delta Studio. The crew were unfriendly and even borderline rude towards non-Korean passengers. I repeatedly observed them being very friendly and all smiles towards Korean passengers, however, the treatment towards non-Korean passengers was different. I believe this is because they felt more obliged to be courteous towards their local passengers. The biggest complaint I have though is the food. Food portions were terribly small and mostly tasteless. Halfway through the flight, I ate a sandwich which I purchased at the airport and flight attendant told me I was not allowed to eat outside food. This surprised me as I thought outside food was only not permitted only on budget carriers. Overall, it's still better than a 3-star airline, but there are now airlines out there that are better than Korean Air.",The crew were unfriendly
Korean Air,"Incheon to Bangkok. After flying from Hawaii to Bangkok several times with Korean Air, I can say that there is nothing very impressive about this airline. It's not that anything is especially awful, but it's my impression that the company and its personnel are several rungs below their competitors. They lack the charm, cleverness, efficiency, and poise of other airlines, and are often lax and simply sloppy. On one recent flight, a member of the cabin staff spilled a tray of drinks on me while he was serving them to other passengers; on another recent flight, I was exiting the toilet and a flight attendant was literally running up the aisle and ran straight into me and knocked me out of the way and, without stopping, yelled, oops! and shrugged and carried on running. Their Thai staff are by far their best. Korean Air's catering is unappetizing, the interiors of their aircraft are uncomfortable, and their uniforms look something like pajamas. The entertainment on board is limited, dull and needs improvement fast and, most surprisingly for such a supposedly technologically-advanced country, Korean Air's website and app are clumsy and not at all user friendly. The airlines likes to make choosing a seat as difficult as possible and it's now only possible to do so when signed in as a member of the airline's frequent flier program, despite my preference for earning mileage with one of their codeshare partners. Does Korean Air know what codesharing actually is? Finally, Incheon airport is new, but beyond shopping there's actually not much to do and it's not very much fun. So, in short, nothing awful, but Korean Air is far, far behind ANA, JAL, EVA air, Thai Airways and Singapore Airlines, and can only really compete by being cheap.",nothing very impressive
Korean Air,"Hong Kong to Shenyang via Seoul. Korean Air has recently introduced a ridiculous policy of not allowing online or app-based seat changes (even for Biz class) unless you are a member of their program. Their response is it is a security issue. But it seems they just want to collect even more information than they already have and discourage your use of your other program membership, I am an elite Skyteam member via Delta, and all I want to do is change my seat. this is both pre and during online check-in. Really doesn't make sense. Thousands paid for the ticket and I can't even choose the seat I want. Very disappointing but inline with the overall poor customer service performance I am accustomed to receiving on Korean Air. I am not sure if they truly understand the concept of alliances and the purpose of sticking with an alliance like Skyteam. They really need to consider this poor service with their customers.",overall poor customer service
Korean Air,"Los Angeles to Bangkok via Seoul. Senior ground staff full of attitude. Traveling with pet did not get pre-boarding unlike other airlines have always given my special assistance. Cabin crew are ignorant. I asked for hot water and got refused by a crew member saying that “no, we don’t give hot water here”. I asked for a special meal and only got a meal with no drink. The cart came after and the crew skipped serving a drink to me as I assumed they think that I have gotten everything. Overall experience is bad since on-ground to onboard the aircraft.",experience is bad
Korean Air,"The experience onboard Korean was underwhelming. Flew from DLC-ICN-LAX. The first leg was a quick hour flight onboard a 777 with good entertainment and was served a small lunch consisting of a chicken sandwich, pineapple and a beverage. The second leg was delayed for 1.5 hours after boarding due to technical issues. Leg space and seating on A380 was great, however I found the in-flight entertainment and meals subpar. The movie offerings were limited with a few new releases and between 15-20 old movies. Moreover, meals left a lot to be desired as the portions were small and snack options were limited to asian shrimp crackers, plain crackers and banana bread. Cabin stewardess did a fine job, going through the motions of carrying on their duties, but there wasn't any personal touch or personality to their interactions. I'd fly Korean Air again if the price is less than better competitors.",experience onboard Korean was underwhelming
Korean Air,"Seoul to Sydney. I am a very nervous flier and I let the cabin crew know this. The first lady, who was showing customers to seats took this very seriously and was very welcoming and also checked up on me at the end and kindly wished me farewell.  This lady assigned staff to look after me during the flight, Moon was the loveliest, kindest air hostess I have ever met. She stayed with me during bouts of turbulence (without neglecting her other hostess duties to other customers) and checked on me throughout the flight. She also distracted me by chatting to me about my time in Korea and assuring me that we were safe, as well as bringing me water and comforting me. I would love to be able to recommend her and thank her for her amazing help. Thank you Moon!",thank her for her amazing help
Korean Air,"Paris to Seoul Incheon. First time flying in Korean Air business class with Prestige sleeper seats. The food was very good quality and the flight attendants were attentive and professional. I normally cannot sleep longer than 2 hours on a flight, but managed to get around 4-5 hours on the flight. The noise-cancelling headphones while not on par with Sony or Bose's top of the line models still worked well enough. IFE was good but not on par with Singapore Airlines or Emirates.",food was very good quality
Korean Air,"Seoul to Madrid. The flight crew provided professional and courteous service. I like flying on the Boeing 787 and it did not disappoint. The  economy food is never a great quality for any airline, but it was adequate. One thing I like with Korean Air is that flight attendants always try to meet your request and on this flight was no exception. The new economy seats and IFE screens were good. IFE movie and TV show selection could be more extensive. As majority of Koreans fly on Korean Air if they had more Korean movies and TV shows, Korean passengers would appreciate that.",IFE screens were good
Korean Air,"Sydney to Incheon. The flight crew provided professional and courteous service. One thing I like about A-330 plane is that seat configuration is 2-4-2 and my wife and I sat on the window side. The plane was clean and the seats were updated with 18.1 width and seat pitch better than other airlines. One area that is not as good as other airlines such as Singapore or Emirates is the IFE. The selection is still not as extensive as these top tier airlines. But, overall a good value travelling on long-distance flights to Europe. Good to note that as travel to Europe requires overnight stay in Incheon, Korean Air provides free hotel and food vouchers.",professional and courteous
Korean Air,"Rome Fiumicino to Seoul Incheon with Korean Air. Overall, a great flight. I rode this flight yesterday (July 8th flight). The ground service? Fantastic because I was in business and at 6pm the check-in counter was open and I could check in within 10 minutes even though our family had 5 baggages (1 baggage / member) because of the great customer assistance. Then, I headed to the lounge. Better than Korean Air's own lounge in ICN. Have pizza, pasta, etc. Great. 10 out of 10. Now, the flight. Everything was great except for the IFE Selection. It was worse than my December 2018 Shanghai Pudong flight. Another Con: No inflight wifi. But I would recommend this airline as always.",would recommend this airline as always
Korean Air,"Seoul to London. Pleasant in-flight attendants and good quality food. However, the seats are somewhat out of date and the airport check in staff, even in the Premium Check In Zone is very rude.",seats are somewhat out of date
Korean Air,"Seoul to Bangkok. Generally, staff at Korean Air are good, food is pretty tasty and the onboard entertainment is varied but unfortunately gets interrupted all the time in 3 different languages. Strangely for a technologically advanced nation, they fall down on their website and general technology. Their website in Korea accepts Korean or International cards. If you're an expatriate, your Korean card won't work and if you use an International card you're likely to be singled out for fraud because (quite rightly) the credit card company won't share information with a vendor. The process to overcome this is to type your entire credit card number into their system to unlock your booking. The option not to do this is unavailable and no mention is made of what happens to this very private data once it's been entered into their system. Additionally, the company air miles system regularly doesn't recognise you've flown with Korean Air and the claims system makes absolutely no sense so I'd be surprised if I ever manage to claim. It's hard to give them a great rating when it's so hard to book with them and they're overpriced because the whole economy here is one big monopoly, but I've increased my score because their staff are goods.",it's so hard to book with them
Korean Air,"Incheon to New York. I am a delta platinum medalion member so I am getting sky team elite plus status when I fly any skyteam. But quite a few Korean air staff are not aware of this. when I check in I'm eligible to use their business class counter but staff didn't know so I had to explain about this. Once they led me to morning calm counter (which belongs to their own membership system) and I'm not really morning calm member or anything. Yesterday when I was checking in, I knew I can check in three bags after checking allowance for sky team elite plus but they said I can check in only two bags then - when I ask them to double check they said I'm able to do so. It was very bothering experience every time I had to explain about their own  system? They even promote their strong alliance with Delta airline everywhere.",very bothering experience
Korean Air,"I was flying on business from Chicago to Korea. With the flight attendants its like they ask you a question and before you can answer, they’re already suggesting something else. Mind you, the flight wasn’t full so there’s no reason why they should rush. What really annoyed was when they started serving coffee and desert, they asked me if I wanted coffee or tea, instead I asked for water. To my dismay, the stewardess answered me don’t you have a bottled water provided for in your seat?  I told her, I was saving it for the longer part of the trip so I wouldn’t have to bother her! Aside from the very limited options Korean Air is just a piece of work. I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone.",wouldn’t recommend it
Korean Air,"Incheon to London Heathrow with Korean Air. Generally comfortable plane, given I'm 193cm. Felt I had just enough leg room. Food was good, with a choice between Korean and plainer options.

Korean Air,"Tokyo to Seoul. Check in is quick, seats are pretty good the only thing is that headphones and blankets are not available in the seats so you need to ask for some.

Korean Air,"San Francisco to Brisbane via Seoul. We love flying Korean Air, we try use it whenever we fly, the service and comfort and quality is outstanding and especially love the new windows that darken instead of the window screens. I only have one issue, since when did aircrafts allow heaters and for it to get so hot. My last couple of flights with Korean air, I became very faint because the air control is just way too hot! I had to fan myself and ask for cold drinks and if they can change the air temperature. I saw one man fanning himself too and a lady with an automatic fan hand held fan fanning herself. This makes the flight extremely uncomfortable and a little embarrassing when it’s such a long haul flight and your sitting in your own sweat because the temperature is too warm. This should be looked into as the aircraft provides blankets for people to use, so people should be able to use them right? I have walked off the aircraft today so uncomfortable and sweaty and quite faint throughout the flight which is a major concern for myself and others. Other than the heat it’s fabulous.",Other than the heat it’s fabulous
Korean Air,Sapporo to Phuket via Seoul. Horrendous problem solving by the Korean Air team. We were left to wait on on the plane for 3.5 hours due to engine failure and upon reaching Seoul they didn't come up with any viable solution to replace our missed Korean Air connecting flight! Their solution in the end is to downgrade us all  from our original business class seating to economy. Even though my husband and I paid a  Business class ticket we had upgraded our small children using points from a paid economy ticket to business tickets. So we have now lost half a day for extra travel time. Since they are now rerouting us via Hong Kong 2) Insulted by the KoreanAir team by their Lack of acknowledgement of their Screw up and Our right to proper seatings. Absolutely no proper compensation for our loss on Business class tickets and Morning Calm mileage points. It's most shocking and mind you we are traveling with our very patient but very exhausted 6 year old twins!,Horrendous problem solving

I don't if it's only me but the seats feel smaller compare to other airline. The meals were okay, I would never give a bad review over the meals and seats size.

Anyway aside from attitude, I have been flying with different airlines and usually they will let me check in my luggage as long as it does not exceed the weight limits. It happens that I brought along 2 small luggages this time. They only let me check in 1 luggage which weights less than 6kg (my entitlement is 23kg) and advise have to pay for another one. I decided to hand carry the other luggage and ended up throwing away a few newly bought cosmetic as the airport guy does not let me bring to the plane.

Tried to fly and solve things in person. Alaska Airlines let me fly with my baby but Korean air refused to even talk to me. Threatened to call security. They also closed the gate early and turned people away. I suspect that it was overbooked but they refused to say.

Korean Air,"Seoul to Kuala Lumpur. New aircraft but hardware was very dated. Seat is true-flat but not comfortable. In partially reclined position it provides no armrests. Tray table is unsupported and slants when the when the food tray is placed on it. A laptop will gradually slide off unless constantly repositioned. Window seats in the upper deck are more spacious than aisles which are constricted by walls and offer zero storage space accessible from the seat. The partition between seats is just plain awkward. Barely enough space to balance a drink precariously without deploying the slanted table. Pillow and blanket are economy standard, and not appropriate for overnight flights. IFE is substandard with few choices. Service is mediocre, hampered by poor English. Attendants have their rote routine but cannot cope with anything spontaneous like a change of wine with main course, water refills out of the designated timeframe, or drinks outside of regular service times.They are very polite but this does not translate into effective service. Ground staff at the Prestige check-in desk lack even this basic politeness, again, possibly because of a lack of linguistic skills in English. Wine selection is excellent but food is quite simply the worst I've had in a premium cabin of a full service carrier.",hardware was very dated

Korean Air,"I had booked on Korean Air on 14th October 2018 to fly from Los Angeles to Seoul and Seoul to Singapore with my family. I had web checked-in inside the airport at 2pm for 11.30pm flight and was shocked to see that the seats were allotted in separate 4 different places. Then, I tried to find three seats together and one seat in between another passenger. Don't they have some common sense that how can I make my two kids sit separately and my wife separately for 20 hours journey. So, immediately I had asked the staff at 8pm once boarding pass was started. She simply replied that she cannot give 4 seats together. Then, I contacted the manager, and I requested him at least speak to the passenger to shift the seat to the next seat. He did not even have the courtesy to try and speak to the passenger. He bluntly refused without an attempt. Then, I spoke to the passenger in between my seats and he immediately accepted to change his seats.",make my two kids sit separately
Korean Air,"My wife and I went to Incheon International Airport to do our check in, with more than 3 hours in advance and surprisingly, the gentleman on the counter told us that the only chance to seat together is on the middle seats on the combination 2-4-2. We asked how is that possible and he told us that most of the seats are reserved by travel agencies for honeymooners, then, they do seat separate? He said he cannot do anything. We looked for customer service from Korean Air on the new Terminal 2 but they don't have. Information told us to call to their call center. While waiting in from of the boarding gate, another couple were taking about they face same issue but they call their travel agency and after some complains Korean Air gave to then seats together. Lucky them! Once on board service was friendly, until on the second part of the flight, the route is Seoul-Colombo-Male, I asked one of the cabin crew if it is possible to get some instant noodles, he went to check and he said sorry we don't have, then my wife asked another cabin crew in Korean and she said sorry we don't serve on the second part of the flight because the flight is shorter.

Thank you Korean Air for the bad customer service.",the bad customer service
Korean Air,"Denpasar to Dallas Ft Worth via Seoul. Absolutely, without a doubt the worst flight that I have experienced in the last 20 years. I am a pretty frequent flyer, and used to be a private pilot, so I make quite a few concessions as a customer for those reasons. Seat pitch was abysmal. I pretty much spent seven hours with my knees around my shoulders (I'm 6'4 tall) ended up getting the worst leg cramps because the seat-belt like was on for most of the flight, and we were told not to leave our seats. Plane was like a sauna. Really old A330 with no air vents available. It's bad enough doing long haul without having so sweat and then smell because of excessive heat and humidity as well. Cabin crew: This was unbelievable - a seven hour flight, in a hot aircraft, and the cabin crew sat down the back of the aircraft chatting away. Did not even serve any drinks, even a glass of OJ would have made me feel better. They finally decided to serve food and drinks five hours into a seven hour flight. How they get a rating of 8 out of 10 is beyond me.",worst flight I have experienced
Korean Air,"Taipei to San Francisco via Seoul Incheon. Very friendly crew, enjoyed my flight even with some delay at Incheon airport due to bad weather.

Will definitely travel with Korean Air again!",travel with Korean Air again
Korean Air,"Auckland to Seoul. I found a lot of the business class service systems of Korean Air quite odd; whilst the crew were polite and responsive, they are working within a set system that means their business class product is sub-par. For example, your menu - which includes the wine list - is taken off you immediately after departure, so you cannot refer back to it. This makes ordering wine particularly difficult. Another thing is that if you order the Korean meal options, then you are deprived of the additional food - such as a soup starter, and bread - that people ordering Western meal options receive. They are not even offered, and as a result, I was starving after my small bowl of rice porridge; I've never been left hungry after a meal, even in Economy class. There was no indication of what snacks were on offer; luckily I was sitting next to a frequent flier and he kept ordering interesting snacks and so I followed suit. On a 12 hour, day-time flight, during which two meals were served, there were only two 'drink runs' by the crew - and they were both during the second meal service. I had to constantly request a drink, and at one stage even went to the galley to see what types of wine were available. I really didn't like this approach to service; I much rather have the drinks offered, rather than have to proactively request for them. However, this seems to be the way they do things - you won't be offered anything beyond the bare minimum, but staff are happy to respond if you do request things. The IFE was poor - a very limited selection of main-stream movies, and little in the way of reading materials. The seat was comfortable, and the cabin was spotless - including the toilets which were regularly cleaned. So whilst the hard product was good, and the service was polite and efficient, I really felt it was a 'bare bones' service culture and therefore, I did not feel pampered or spoilt, as I usually do in Business class. It really felt they were trying to minimise costs by keeping the food and drink away from the public eye.",business class product is sub-par
Korean Air,Manila to Los Angeles via Seoul. Our problem started when an aircraft had an emergency in manila and we missed our connecting flight in Seoul to LAX.

Korean Air,"Manila to New York via Seoul. I am very disappointed with Korean Air. I am traveling with four kids ages 10 months, 5yrs, 10 yrs and 14yrs. Our flight from Manila to Korea got delayed which caused us to miss our connecting flight to New York. I spoke 4 times with their customer service to try and arrange a flight for my family and they are not accommodating at all. The best answer they can give me is go to the airport and talk to the desk and try to schedule a flight there cause they have more access. I explained to them that I have 8 luggage's and 4 kids which will make it very difficult to do that without a confirmed flight. I got so tired of begging and explaining to them the situation so I finally gave in and took a flight with a 10 hour lay over. The worst part of it all is I did not even ask for a hotel room. I just asked to be allowed to stay in the Korean Air lounge so that my kids can at least rest but they did not even give me that. My family and I travel every year and with this experience I highly doubt that Korean air will be on our list of Airlines choice. I don't agree with the saying customer are always right but I should not have to keep begging and explaining my situation with traveling with four kids.",I am very disappointed

Korean Air,"Chicago to Bangkok via Seoul. I did not make to the Korean air portion of the flight, so this more about the service. Weather caused our American Airlines initial flight (all booked through the Korean Air website), to be delayed multiple times causing us to miss our connecting flight to Seoul and ultimately to Bangkok. Called the Korean air service line and they suggested requesting the gate agent to ask them to hold the flight. American agents said Korean does not do that. After calling both airline service lines and having close to an hour delay, they both said the other airlines had to change it. American was adamant this is a Korean ticket and only they can release to change. BTW, 2 kids under 5 that had been up since 4 am, so we were not in the mood to run around the airport. Chicago transfer agent K20 gate, wouldn’t let us transfer, so had to go out of security to get to terminal 5. So took the bus, with whole family in tow, to terminal 5. The Korean Air agents used very polite words to say it wasn’t their problem, they would not help and the best they could do was standby for tomorrow and since the flight was full, very unlikely to go tomorrow. That was the last straw. Helping me to resolve the problem is the job of the Korean Air service counter team, when I bought tickets from their company. The utter lack of caring or willingness to do anything amazed me. Korean Air lost a customer for life today. I had used Korean air for last 10+ years at least 2-3 round trips Asia a year. Will stick with someone else from now on.",utter lack of caring
Korean Air,"Seoul Incheon to Amsterdam. I was satisfied with this flight overall. Check in process was friendly and efficient at Incheon airport, even though I arrived with less than an hour until departure. The seat was quite comfortable for a long trip, with plenty of leg room. I would say that the entertainment is not as good as on many other international airlines, but better than Asiana, with a reasonably interesting range of movies but a fairly lousy range of TV shows. I ordered a gluten free meal and was quite happy with the quality - probably one of the better GF meals I've had on a plane, but unfortunately Korean airlines don't seem to ever manage to provide GF bread. The range of drinks was okay, but again, I think it's smaller than many other international carriers, even in economy. The flight attendants serving my aisle were friendly and personable and made a real effort to interact with the passengers in a warm way - this was the most impressive part of the experience for me. Plane arrived on time in Paris and the toilets were kept clean for the whole trip.",friendly and personable
Korean Air,"Los Angeles to Chiang Mai via Seoul. We decided to spend a little bit more for our flight to Thailand in exchange for a better service and were disappointed: We could have saved several hundreds of dollars if we had used a Chinese budget airline. What was good about Korean Air were the flight attendants who were super friendly and helpful, on our return flight to LAX they even carried my carry on bag for me, when they saw that I was holding our baby. The reason why we won't fly with Korean Air anymore: I had ordered a vegetarian oriental meal (not vegan, but vegetarian which isn't as restrictive) What I received was a joke: it looked like someone had emptied half a can of peas into the aluminum container and thrown some bok choi leaves on top. No sauce, tofu, rice or potatoes. Horrible. My wife was still hungry after her meal and asked for a snack. The answer was: we don't carry any snacks (contrary to what their website says: Snack Service A wide variety of snacks, such as samgak kimbop, cup ramen, pizza, and makkoli rice cakes, are served on long flights. The flight attendant explained: we stopped offering cup ramen because of the smell when my wife told him that she used to get ramen on previous flights.  I had one can of beer at the beginning of the flight and ordered a gin tonic several hours later. This drink spilled because my table was defective (the kind which you pull out from the armrest). When I asked for another drink they watered it down and advised me this is your last drink, each passenger is allowed to have only 3 drinks. I was not the slightest little bit drunken and very surprised because even on low budget airlines like Air India nobody told me how many drinks I could have. This is obviously a policy which is supposed to save the airline money.  We both started to get a headache because of dehydration. When I asked for water, the flight attendant poured approximately 4 table spoons into a cup, I went back and forth several times between our seats and the pantry and each time they filled the cup only 50%. We were both thirsty during the entire flight. Before departure there was a bottle of water on each seat and as soon as the boarding was completed, they hurried to collect the water bottles from the vacant seats. (Probably in order to lock them up in the safe...) 5.) We had purchased an inflatable pillow which was specifically designed for air travel. As soon as my wife started to inflate the pillow, several flight attendants approached us saying that we were not allowed to use it.  Obviously Korean Air's management made decisions in order to save money and we felt this nickel and dime culture during the entire trip. If we had chosen a low cost Chinese airline, we may have received some kind of rude treatment but enough to eat and drink for several hundred Dollars less.",nickel and dime culture
Korean Air,"I have flown with KE a few times now. This time around it was less than stellar. Arrived 3hrs and 30 minutes prior to departure. Well, check-in wasn’t a pleasant experience. It took me 1 hour to check in luggage due to the fact there was only 2 counters opened and there was a huge line to check in. Transit was a breeze and enjoyable due to the fact that Korean Air uses the new T2 in Incheon. The flight to JFK was good and comfortable, food was good. No complains here. Aside from the 1 hour check in, it was still a good experience. I have read bad reviews about seat comfort, but you get leg room which is around 33-34” and lets remember most airlines comes with a 31-32” leg room.",Transit was a breeze
Korean Air,"Manila to New York via Seoul-Incheon. The aircraft was in excellent condition. The cabin was clean and smelling good and seats had ample leg room. IFE was okay but has limited selection. Food was above average but could taste better. Cabin crew are kind and warm but could've been more attentive to needs, as there was a point they stop delivering drinks (you know how it gets too dry in the throat during long-haul flights). My biggest concern with my flight was the absence of footrest in economy seats and perhaps the biggest factor why I'll rather fly Asiana in my next trip.",absence of footrest in economy
Korean Air,"Business class from Singapore to Seoul. We checked-in from terminal 4, there is an exclusive area in the lounge for first class passengers,. Food was below average, flight service and smile was good, IFE was acceptable, camera onboard was acceptable, and the seat was extremely comfortable on this 6 hour flight. I was disappointed though that no amenity kit was provided on this red-eye flight. We arrived at terminal 2 in Incheon airport where the experience was extremely positive for us compared to terminal 1. I would definitely fly Korean Air again. However, unfortunately they do not have routes to the Middle East.",would fly Korean Air again
Korean Air,"Auckland to Osaka via Seoul. The leg room was impressive, I am 6'1 and can sit comfortably. Meal service was great. Crew was warm and with smiles. The only thing is that the In-flight entertainment system, compare to CX and NZ, the choices of the movies were limited. Nevertheless, I would fly with KE again for sure.",I would fly with KE again
Korean Air,"Seoul to Tokyo Narita. I use my mom's credit card to buy my flight ticket. But, When I was check in at the counter in Incheon, They required me to show my mom's credit card, if not I need to buy a new ticket again (refund for old ticket). Because I study in Seoul and my mom is in Thailand, it is impossible to show them. But, I asked other friends who also use their's parents card to buy, they doent need to show the card. So it is kinda confuse me. Also, The flight was delay for 1 hour too Anyways, I really hate this process and it quite annoying, I will not use this airline again in the future.",not use this airline again
Korean Air,"Singapore to Seoul. Flight arrived either early or on time. However, I had selected my seats for both legs, immediately after I bought the tickets online (via Korean Air website). On both legs, our seats were assigned to worse options. The Singapore-Seoul leg, we were given seats further back on the aircraft. I chose front rows as we didn't have check in luggage and therefore, could clear the airport quicker. The Seoul-Singapore leg, not only were our seats reassigned but we were separated. At the check in counter at the airport, the clerk managed to get us two seats together. However, we were wedged between two other passengers making it a tight squeeze. I had selected two seats together - the aircraft to Seoul had better seat configuration and leg space.  While they had 3 options to choose from, the food on both legs was below par. Even low cost carriers give better quality food.",the food was below par
Korean Air,"Vancouver to Cebu via Seoul. We’ve flown with Korean air before and received services for their 12 hour layover in Incheon without issue. We paid more to book with them this time and now they’re refusing to honour the layover service due to a block out period. We would’ve never booked a flight that has a 12hr layover knowing that there wouldn’t be a layover service. When I tried to call they half listened and kept repeating “no”. I would never recommend flying with Korean Air anymore. It’s really not worth it to pay more to have such a long layover when other airlines have cheaper flights with much shorter layovers. Initially they told us that they offered the services to offset the long layover in comparison to other airlines but now they’ve reneged on that, there’s no benefit to flying with them anymore. If they would’ve been even a bit more polite and accommodating to our concerns, I wouldn’t be writing this review but when I asked them what they would recommend us to do on our 12 hour layover, they said “I don’t know”.",never recommend flying Korean Air
Korean Air,"Taipei to Seoul. The stewardesses were  polite, and helpful. I was surprised by the comparative good quality of meals they provided for a less than 3 hour flight from Taipei to Seoul -- with metal cutlery. The aircraft was new and comfy with many entertainment choices. You don't need to beg for pillows or blankets - these were automatically provided to you.  Their ground staff in Seoul do need to improve their English skills if they want to attract more international travelers.",aircraft was new and comfy
Korean Air,"Seoul to Beijing. I wanted to say thank you for your wonderful employees at the check-in and help desk. I had a problem with my flight, and they assisted me from start to finish while being polite, helpful, and nice. They made my situation into a less stressful situation.","polite, helpful, and nice"
Korean Air,"Ho Chi Minh to Seattle via Incheon. It was a nice experience, great legroom on economy seats and the recline is pretty good. The food was excellent, I love the Korean Bibimpap they served. The cabin crew really inactive, they were very lazy to clean passenger's trash, although it was in their sight and very obvious. They should also have more bathrooms or let economy passenger use their premium class bathroom because most of the time it was not occupied.",It was a nice experience
Korean Air,"It was an international travel from Fukuoka (Japan) to Delhi (India) via Seoul (South Korea) with Korean Air. Due to the bad weather condition, the airline was kept on postponing the estimated time of departure in Fukuoka (Japan) Airport. The flight from Fukuoka to Seoul was 5.30 hours delayed approximately. During that time the staff at Fukuoka airport provided a can of coffee and nothing else. Anyway, I was worried since I needed to board another Korean Air flight from Seoul to Delhi. Unfortunately, I couldn't board that flight. I contacted airlines staff and the staff suggested for me to take the next days flight from Seoul to Delhi. The staff happily showed incapability to provide any lounge/hotel for one night stay as well. I was supposed to reach Seoul in afternoon but landed late evening. I was completely exhausted and hungry also knowing that I needed to spend one night and a day until the afternoon (15 hours approximately) before boarding the flight to Delhi. Now, the flight to Delhi kept being postponed. During this time period, I contacted airport enquiries and tried to contact airline staff but couldn't find the airline staff. The airline didn't provide any food since they didn't bother to contact me at all. Note that the flight which was supposed to take off in the afternoon was finally rescheduled to 20.00 hours approximately which made my spend 24 hours at Incheon Airport (Seoul) approximately. It was indeed a pathetic experience and I was left with no energy. The airline should treat the passenger properly and also provide accommodation if flights are rescheduled. I would definitely not recommended Korean Air to anyone.",a pathetic experience
Korean Air,"San Francisco to Jakarta via Incheon. To be clear, the prestige class cabins in Korean are not cutting edge, they aren't the best in the skies. Infact, the seat width are quite narrow, and could be noticed when trying to stretch out. Though, while they lack on the hard product, they throw all this over with their soft product. The cabin crew were very disciplined and very friendly. They did speak perfect English and did go around the cabin a lot to make sure if anyone needs a drink or would like some freshly baked cookies that they have just made (they were excellent). They had excellent food and a lot of it. They were all cooked to perfection, both the Korean and Western meals. Although I would recommend the Korean dishes because they are after all, a Korean Airline. IFE is acceptable with new movies and a good airshow that worked, so no complaints there. Overall, Korean Air has reasonable fares from Asia to North America and is worth the price. Even though the seat is not cutting edge, you will be able to sleep (especially because of food coma). I do not have enough words to express just how perfect the cabin crew were, and they made the whole experience worthy.",perfect cabin crew
Korean Air,"New York JFK to Manila via Incheon. This is really a great flight for me, the food was delicious and the FA's are pretty, polite and attentive to my needs. We were on time in the departure. I have no complaints of Korean Air. My Seoul to Manila flight was excellent with an on time performance and I loved the ice cream. The snacks were really great and they served hot snacks.",FA's polite and attentive
Korean Air,"New York JFK to Shanghai via Seoul. The 747-800 is an excellent plane and the new Korean Air business configuration is comfortable. The rest of my most recent KE travel was ridiculous. Checking in to a disinterested Prestige class desk, I was told they had no record of the 3rd leg of my flight. She was happy to leave it there quite unconcerned, if or when my luggage would reach KK but with much prodding found a manager who eventually rectified that issue, much stress pre-boarding from a Delta partner. No cocktails were offered. The meal was so small and of such poor quality that I was shocked. Wine in the regular tiny glasses was offered once after meal, the fruit (only dessert) was as unripe and as unappealing as was the disinterested service. Since they offer virtually no snacks on the 14 hour flight in Business class, I requested some more food and was given an old chicken sandwich on raisin bread which was probably crew food. I was asked if I wanted to be awakened for the second meal 2 hours before landing - yes! When the lights went up and the loud service began I thought I slept well and was near landing, however breakfast was served in a fully lit cabin 4.5 hours before arrival, also, small and uninteresting - then duty free shopping was announced and flouted. Then after all were awake lights went out for 2 hours before landing. Service was inexcusable, especially the lack of water. At one point I was told they were out of water but someone found a bottle. The FA's were just not interested in a smile or any effort to make me feel welcome. The purser was unconcerned about my issues and explained this was the normal flight plan. Since he and the cabin crew have little conversational English ability, I was lost. The flight from Incheon to Pudong was much better. There are myriad choices transpacific and KE should not be considered for Business class fares. Flight 086 on Jan 9 2018 was a true disgrace to what may be considered a reputable airline.",Service was inexcusable
Korean Air,"Seoul to Amsterdam. When we travel as a family, they should have knowledge and control over which seat to be given. They prioritise their home citizens first. When asked nicely if they could change it or move some passengers, they just replied not possible. Worst airline ever attended. As a family we have never experienced a airline which gave seats 1 by 1 when we are a family. Therefore we will never travel with Korean Air again.",never travel with Korean Air again
Korean Air,"Frankfurt to Shanghai via Seoul. One of the best business seats I have experienced. Check in in Frankfurt went smoothly. The lounge was ok but nothing special. Had a seat at upper deck of Boeing 747-8 at the window. Spacious with privacy and a nice HD monitor, it was full flat bed. Staff was extremely helpful and competent. Food was ok with a choice of western and Korean food. Flight was in time. Transfer in Incheon was uncomplicated, the lounge there could be better. Quiet poor choice of food, but the lounge had a smoking room and draft beer. Flight from ICN to PVG was also nice business class experience, especially when considering that this was just a good hour flight. Return flight had same standard. Overall a very good experience.",a very good experience
Korean Air,"Los Angeles to Incheon. The booking, check in and website infrastructure/system are very frustrating and error prone. I have been on multiple flights with them and almost missed a flight because my boarding pass would not scan at the gate. Recently my flight was delayed because people had trouble boarding at the gate as well. Checking in on their website has been an issue because the information requested had no entry field. Checking in at the kiosk at the airport printed all of my fellow travelers boarding passes but only 1 of mine. When I tried to check in to print the rest of mine it errored out and I had to wait for the check in time for my flight at the korean air counter so a person could fix it. A lot of small annoyances add up to make this airline an unpleasant one to travel with. Also the seats on their smaller planes are concave and incredibly uncomfortable. The bigger planes are better.",unpleasant one to travel with
Korean Air,"Seoul to Moscow. I had a positive experience with Korean Air. Cabin crew was helpful and gentle, food was quite ok, IFE had the biggest screen I had seen. The film choice was not as big as in other airlines but I found many good titles to watch. The seat was really comfortable with loads of room for my legs. The only minus was the ground service. Baggage drop was really long and chaotic.",I had a positive experience
Korean Air,"Seoul to Prague. Check in very fast. Was seated in the upper deck of the 747-8i. Amazing aircraft, the prestige suites are very private, and the extra storage along the window is most welcome. The cabin was spotlessly clean, and two bathrooms upstairs is a plus as most airlines only have one. Cabin Crew are very professional and friendly, and always immaculately presented. The food was of good standard. The entertainment is a bit limited, however that doesn't really bother me as I do not use the IFE that much. ICN is a great airport, although the Korean air lounge isn't really worth a visit, they should invest more into their lounges. Overall a great experience, Korean Air is one of the more premium airlines to fly.",food was of good standard
Korean Air,"Seoul to Manila. Worst flight experience ever. You go to the gate they told you at the checking in counter and when you are there; no program, no sign, nothing. When I went to the Korean Air customer service they told me after a 3 hour waiting line, that the flight will leave 5 hours later then expected. When we are 5 hours later, still no plan and again waiting for hours. This all without any information, or announcements. They also didn't offer a voucher for even a meal. Also not giving any option by claiming costs. This whole combination, I haven't ever experienced it ever before. Third world countries experiencing typhoons manage the airplanes and communication better.",Worst flight experience ever
Korean Air,"Seoul to Kathmandu. First was told 3 hour delay due to technical difficulties then further 2 hr delay due to same reason. When asked, no proper reasoning was provided. All was said was sorry. I find sorry as a very inadequate answer to such a huge problem. Lack of proper answer and reasoning to delay from airlines authority was more than aggravating. No compensation whatsoever and shady reasoning gives me enough reason to avoid this airlines in my future travel. And would strongly recommend others to avoid this airline.",recommend to avoid this airline
Korean Air,"San Francisco to Tokyo via Seoul. The flight from Seoul to Tokyo Haneda delayed 3 times so far. The airline failed to inform passengers as soon as they knew about a delay. The first delay I found out at the boarding gate near the scheduled boarding time - 3 hour delay. The second delay was known 30 minutes after the boarding time, after we pressed an airline employee to find out, while he appeared to be running away - another 3 hour delay. The third delay is announced at the boarding time, unknown how long until further notice. To their credit, they gave out bottled water once during this long, frustrating process. But nothing else, no explanation, no other accommodation. Some local passengers were yelling, many lied around trying to get some sleep. Inquiries made in English were met with very limited response. We were not given a chance to plan for alternatives, with the late announcements or lack of transparency. We are still waiting.",failed to inform passengers
Korean Air,"San Francisco to Mumbai via Seoul. This is a cheaper option to travel to India. Also since the flights are approx. 12 and 10 hours duration, it doesn't become very tiring towards the end. However they have flights only thrice , week. This is the second time I flew with them. The San Francisco to Seoul flight has more legroom but to Mumbai just cramps everyone. I have tried both Indian non veg/veg and regular flight food and found both quite good. However their portion size is very small. And they don't have much snack options like banana or chips available like in other flights. So I ended up being hungry all the time and literally waiting for food. Economy class service is just Ok. The crew is not bad but like someone said they are very robotic and no warmth at all. And one or two can be rude too. IFE is bad, very limited and boring options. Also despite chunk of passengers being from India, they don't offer any Indian entertainment. Still its a value for money courier. But given a choice of same airfare I would prefer another airline.",they are very robotic
Korean Air,"Dallas Ft Worth to Ho Chi Minh City via Seoul. This is the first time I fly Korean air and all of their four legs was delayed. Pretty lousy statistics, I should say. It certainly doesn’t help when your flights are so long and you want to just get through it as quickly as possible. On top of that I was placed in the last row by the bathroom for the nearly 20 hrs flight home. Fortunately I was able to change the seats by going to the airport ticket counter the night before. For the 15 hrs flight from TX to Seoul, only two meals were served. Boy! I was very hungry so on my return flight I packed extra food. Suffice to say future flying with Korean Air will be rather unlikely.",all of their four legs was delayed
Korean Air,"Bangkok to Atlanta via Seoul. My husband booked my flight on Korean Air because of the reputation for great customer service. My husband and I have previously had excellent service when we traveled in coach class. However, my  flight in Prestige Class was very disappointing. The customer service by the flight attendants on all flights was below average. I was expecting a lot more in Prestige Class. On previous flights, we have been treated much better in coach. I selected a noodle dish on KE 035 which was served with ice cubes floating in the bowl. I had to ask for water since the flight attendant rarely came by to ask if anything was needed. On my return (KE 036), I asked for bread but was told no since bread didn't come with my choice of meal. The flight attendant later returned with bread. On flight KE 659, I had to ask for a bottle of water but was told the flight didn't have bottled water. They served me a very small glass of water but didn't come back to see if I needed more water...I had to ask. I find it appalling Korean Air didn't have bottled water. On the same flight, the meal I selected was not good so I ask if I could have the noodle dish. I was shocked when the flight attendant brought me a bag of dried noodles and hot water. I don't know what happened to the excellent customer service experienced on previous flights but my entire flight was not worth the money spent on my Prestige Class ticket. This will be the last time I will ever book a flight on Korean Air. Food was terrible, flight attendants were terrible, the entertainment consisted of very old movies and overall experience was absolutely terrible. Overall rating...less than 1 star. Additionally, the Korean Air lounge at Incheon Airport was absolutely disgusting.",flight attendants were terrible
Korean Air,"JeJu Island to Seoul via Degeau. My wife and I made a mistakes flying from JeJu Island to Seoul by scheduling an impossibly short connection time. The ticket agent recognized this and gave us new seats that allowed us to get off of the plane before other coach passengers, notified the flight attendants that we had a too-short connection who arranged for our checked luggage to come off the conveyor belt first and opened up a baggage check-in lane for us only and our baggage that needed to be re-checked. We made our connection and our luggage arrived with our flight at our final destination. In my wildest dreams I could not imagine this level of personalized service from a US domestic airline. Korea Air deserves more a 10, the highest number on the rating.",level of personalized service
Korean Air,"Bali Denpasar to Seoul Incheon. Check-in was fast and easy by Korean's contracted ground handlers in Denpasar. The flight boarded and pushed back on-time. While the flight overall was fairly comfortable (good seat pitch, good seat-back inflight entertainment, pillow & blanket provided), Korean's cabin crew are very cold and without any personality. They are very robotic in everything they do. The cabin crew was very unfriendly and disingenuous while attending to the passengers - forced, half-smiles when serving the meal and drink service (the breakfast served - was soggy and virtually inedible). This is such a shame because they are dressed to impress and fly onboard such nice airplanes. If only they provided warm, caring hospitality, they would truly be an outstanding airline. Until then, I would not fly on them again by choice.",not fly them again by choice.
Korean Air,"Bangkok to Seoul. A330 Outbound on time, return A380 30 mins late departing. Both planes clean. crew attentive and smart appearance. Food excellent and choice of three main courses; fish on return not served warm enough (below 60c). IFE okay; reasonable choice but not extensive so being marketed as 'Beyond Entertainment' is somewhat misleading. Delay in accepting commands on screen is annoying. Advertisement for Winter Olympics prior to every show or film gets repetitive; Korean Air should proof watch this 50 times to see what their passengers put up with. Overall good value for money. A380 return too hot in economy.",good value for money
Korean Air,"Bangkok to Seoul. We would like to express our appreciation to the cabin staff 24 November 2017. We had an issue with the television during the flight. Once we informed her, she actively tried to coordinate with related people to solve the issue and keep us informed on the progress. Moreover, she came to us and explained the safety demonstration personally. This shows great service as a cabin crew. We really appreciated her kindness and support.",Korean Air customer review
Korean Air,"Flew Incheon to Singapore. The best thing that Korean Air offered was a rather comfortable seat with ample leg space. Inflight entertainment and food were decent, albeit not the best. Flight attendants were rather polite and helpful, although I was rather unhappy that the flight attendant serving me failed to enquire me on my preferred choice for dinner. There were 3 meal options - A, B, and C. For option B, we could choose between beef and chicken. Instead of listing them out for me, like she did for the passengers next to me, the attendant took the shortcut by asking if I was okay with option B. On hearing yes, she handed me a serving of option B with chicken in it, showing no interest at all that I might be more keen on having beef instead.",comfortable seat with ample leg space
Korean Air,"Always fly Korean Air nonstop when I visit friends and family in Atlanta. Last trip 2015. Used Gangnam City Terminal checkin which allowed for expedited security at ICN. At ATL, checkin is always hassle free with no wait when you use the web check in line. Seats still extremely spacious with leg room, flexible headrest and recline. I managed to sleep 7-8 hours in both directions! Cabin spotless. Crew friendly, professional and polite in both English and Korean. Entertainment options are a bit lacking, honestly.

Korean Air,"Seoul to Hanoi. I wish to register my absolute disgust at the totally unacceptable service I received from Korean Air staff at Incheon Airport on September 1st 2017. I was told I have to line up and self check in, which does not work, it worked but not fully, it recognized my Passport but would not allow me to check in as it could not verify my Visa.  So I was asked to check in at a checkin desk. So back to the Line once more. This was now the 2nd Person from Korean Air I spoke with she told me must join this Line, I explained the issue she told me this line this line, I asked again this is for Hanoi yes join this line. So  after 45 minutes I get to the initial entry Ropes of the Check in and am told wrong gate wrong gate, I again tried to explain my concern and issue and was ushered away in a dismissive manner. I then asked another Staff member and still getting any assistance or good feeling whatsoever that I am going to successfully check in. I asked this lady sure this is the line for Hanoi, if this is the line there is no way I can make the flight in time this is now the third line I have been told to join. Do not worry she said no issue you will make it. At 7.50 I have still not checked in and see no way in making my flight and I will not be able to make my appointment in Vietnam thru no fault of my own and what appears to be absolutely no concern from the Korean Air Staff on the Ground. I do not speak Korean so I am automatically dismissed. At 8.00am my Korean Colleagues who had none of the hassles I had as their passports were accepted without Visas spoke to one of the Korean Air Staff who escorted me to a check in desk and personally checked me in. I just made the Flight. I have never in all my years of travelling been so poorly treated. I am still waiting for a Reply from KE Customer Service to my email of Sept 7th 017",totally unacceptable service
Korean Air,"Seoul to Taipei. This is the first time I flew Korean Air after many years and it seems to be a much better airline now. Ground staff was very polite and helpful. Ground and onboard staff were very courteous with a smile on their faces. The plane was clean and relatively comfortable. Food was a bit bland and quantity was a little lacking, but okay for a short flight. Entertainment service was a bit unreliable, with few of the functions on the remote not working well. Very smooth and pleasant flight overall.",pleasant flight overall
Korean Air,"Cebu to Seoul Incheon on a Boeing 777. Seat wise it was comfortable with enough leg space. For a four hour flight to Incheon it felt good, with good service, good food, and IFE! For the price, it was a very good deal in my opinion. Check in was a breeze in Cebu. Even was lucky enough to get bulk head seats. Luggage was checked through so, it was really nice.",Seat wise it was comfortable
Korean Air,"My husband, grandson and myself recently flew Auckland to London return via Seoul. We had made this trip on Korean Air on two previous occasions, and once again enjoyed the complimentary night's accomodation at the 5 star Grand Hyatt at Incheon, which also included a delicious dinner and breakfast. Korean Air is a most generous airline, in terms of legroom in their economy class and the overnight stopover they provide on the Auckland to London flight. What particularly impressed us this trip was the trouble the ground staff went to locate and then hand deliver the wallet my grandson left onboard the aircraft when we landed in Seoul on the homeward leg. It was only when we checked in for the last leg of the flight to Auckland, after a three day stopover in Seoul that he mentioned the wallet was missing. The young lady at check in made a series of phone calls, located the wallet and arranged for it to be delivered to the departure lounge. Korean Air certainly understand the meaning of customer service.",the meaning of customer service
Korean Air,"My wife and I flew to London and returned with Korean Air from Sydney via Seoul, Incheon. KAL was the best value ticket available and included a complimentary night in Incheon on the outward leg of our journey. The quality of the accomodation was 5 star and beyond expectation. In total we had four flights two on Airbus 350 and one on a 747 and one on the A380. The Airbus are all newer aircraft and offer an exceptional flying experience. The 747 was noisier, but the cabin had been retro fitted to a consistent level of quality. The seats in economy are a calm blue or brown colour, are the widest I have experienced in economy and offered ample leg room for my 6ft 2 frame, even when fully reclined. There are no obtrusive underseat boxes. The touch screen inflight entertainment screens are large and offer a cosmopolitan selection which although not as big as some, has something for everyone. Every seat has a point where you can charge your devices, but there is no wifi in economy. There were little bottles of water and headsets on the seats pre boarding. The crew are all impeccably presented in a beautiful cream and green uniform that is a nod to Korean celadon ceramic wear. The food is exceptional if you like the Korean option with the signature dish of bibimbap and doesn't even look like airline food. The western choices are more standard airline presentation. Our son received child's meals and these were colourful and provided a variety of healthy items and sugary treats to suit all levels of fussy. The children's headsets are so cool I was jealous. The boarding procedure was straightforward and we were priority boarded ex Seoul due to travelling with children. The toilets in economy contain high quality branded toiletries and were kept meticulously clean on all flights with crew stationed outside through the quiet times of the flight. The crew themselves were highly professional and had good English. They were attentive to call bells and helpful when asked questions. They are impressively patient with passengers who misunderstand cabin protocol or ignore the seatbelt signs and manage the safety in a charming and caring way, rather than a bossy aggressive manner that can occur on western airlines. On the A380 there is an actual duty free shop at the rear. I have no complaints whatsoever. These were the best four flights that I have ever been on, comparing similar long haul experiences on JAL, ANA, BA, Singapore Airlines and Thai. I believe that the quality is similar to Cathay Pacific but I like their uniform and Korean service style slightly more.

** Asked for ticket",best four flights I have ever been on
Korean Air,"Toronto to Sydney via Seoul Incheon. This was the return leg from Canada. On the 2 outbound and 2 return legs each aircraft economy class was full. The aircraft were clean and in good condition - everything worked. The legroom is remarkable. For a 183cm person I had 10cm of space between my knees and the seat in front - even when it was reclined. Both aircraft on the return had touch-screen IFE, however, the limited choices are a minus. For some reason, the route taken by Korean Air seems afflicted by frequent turbulence. This results in a loud tone when the seat belt sign is illuminated and an announcement, and a second tone when it's switched off. This is very disturbing when one is trying to sleep. Another annoyance with this airline is its lack of enforcement of the cabin baggage rules. In the boarding lounge, many passengers have up to 3 bags resulting in lack of space in the aircraft overhead bins. It was interesting to see the cavernous bins on the 787. The food on both legs was passable with the exception of a beef and pasta offering. The beef was fatty, the pasta stuck to the base of the foil container and the beans and carrots mushy. The cabin on the ICN-SYD was freezing - well, not quite, but it couldn't have been more than 17C. Observing the other passengers, at least 95% were wrapped in the provided blankets. On the three preceeding Korean Air flights I was comfortable in jeans and long-sleeve business shirt, But I had to put on my jacket and wrap up in an blanket also. Two complaints to a cabin attendant made no change. The flight lef Incheon 30 minutes late but landed in Sydney 3 minutes ahead of schedule.",The legroom is remarkable

Korean Air,"London to Auckland return via Seoul. Not having previously flown business class I'm not comparing it to other airlines, however my return trip was cheaper in Korean Business Class than in Cathay Pacific or Air New Zealand Premium Economy. I'm sure Business Class in other airlines may be swankier, but the food was good with adequate choice, staff were attentive, and the cabins were full but quiet. On the way out the two night flights had very spacious layouts with privacy screens, lie flat beds and easy access from window seats to aisle due to staggered arrangement. On the way back it was two day flights in a more basic arrangement but the seats still went flat. Due to the long changeover in Seoul on the way back a free transit hotel was provided - outside the airport but very close to it. Very good hotel, and dinner and breakfast were included. There is only one niggle, that is there wasn't enough choice on the IFE. Dedicated check in desks, lounges clean.",cheaper than premium economy
Korean Air,"Seoul to Los Angeles. If you are buying a ticket for someone else, do not buy. When you are purchase a ticking using your own credit card for someone else, Korean Air will make you go to their Los Angeles office to verify your credit card (payment methods). I have spoken to a customer service rep (English speaker) over the phone and Korean Air will not accept any other method of verification. I think it’s great that they have a strict security system. However, I believe it’s unnecessary to have your customer drive over 50 miles (3 hours in total drive – round trip) to verify that I am the credit card holder.  There were cheaper airline tickets available at the time of purchase. However, I wanted to buy a premium airline ticket (Korean Air, Asiana Air, Singapore Air) for my in-laws. Honestly, this has been the worst experience ever. I wish never made the purchase. Would have saved a lot of money, time and frustration,",I wish never made the purchase
Korean Air,"I have been in a check-in line at Incheon for one hour and still have at least 15 mins more until I reach the front. It is appallingly slow with zero sense of urgency and no assistance for passengers when their flights reach last call. Incheon is supposedly a top and modern airport and I am shocked by this antiquated system. Even Bangkok check-ins move faster than this. If flying Korean Air, you need to arrive 3 hours before.",appallingly slow with zero sense of urgency
Korean Air,"We have just returned from a Christmas trip from Sydney having got business class tickets for £2450 with Korean Air. I think for this money one needs to limit their expectations. It's a flat bed to the other side of the world. Premium carriers were well over £3000. Check in was quick and smooth, the lounges were fine, not top class but for the money more than adequate. Food offering at Seoul was average at best, Sydney breakfast was the best of all. On board everyone was extremely courteous and professional. English was widely spoken. The food offering was pretty good on most sectors even asking how one wanted their steak cooked and then delivering on that offer, the Korean dishes were good especially their signature Bibimbap. I had one dish (cold noodle salad) that wasn't for me, without hesitation after seeing I had not touched it the Flight attendant offered me any other choice I wanted. Korean seems to put less emphasis on drinks than European airlines. Not a bad thing, just different. However once you realise that they only pour about a third of a glass at a time or won't be quick in offering drinks after take off you only had to ask and a drink appeared immediately and with a smile. The wine from LHR was mainly French and pretty average. From ICN-SYD was Californian or Australian and better. There are some new films but the on board entertainment is average. With iPads loaded with films and magazine sthis becomes less important these days. The business bed (the older type on 777's out of Heathrow and the 380 to SYD) were spacious although not the most comfortable for some one 6'3'. They say they are 180 degree flat beds but they aren't completely flat. There was an annoying plastic foot rest that meant you couldn't stretch out enough and the head rest wouldn't push up far enough to not hit your shoulders, along with the pillows being about A4 size. I see that from April Korean are rostering a 747-8 on the LHR-INC route that will have the new prestige sleeper suite. Although also prices are rising to £2550-£2850. I think once you start pushing towards £3k better airlines start to look good value. Due to the near 20 hour gap between flights Korean put you up at The Grand Hyatt hotel at the airport which was fantastic. We had dinner and breakfast included and the food on offer was spectacular. If time is no major concern the ability to break the journey (especially at an airlines expense) have a great nights sleep and then carry on the next day is ideal. I don't think I have ever felt this good after 24 hours of arriving back from Australia.",everyone was extremely courteous and professional
Korean Air,"I often take flight from Seoul to Paris CDG and vice versa. It's long and tiring flight especially when you are in economy. However, I wouldn't be too frustrated about flying 12 hours with Korean Air. First of all, from check in to ground staff all are kind. The last trip was everything I could ask for an economy passenger. The cabin crew service was exceptional. I was very tired so I decide to sleep and miss my meal. Not only did they reserve a meal for me they combined part of an economy meal and business meal to serve me from the middle of nowhere. They checked up on me several times during flight if everything fine until I walked out through boarding gate.",service was exceptional
Korean Air,"I flew to Las Vegas in March 2016. From Manila, I had a layover in Seoul and then flew to Los Angeles. That was a 19 hour flight in total I think. I especially like their spacious legroom. They have excellent food quality. Korean Air's staff are all friendly and attentive to passengers needs. The only thing I didn't like was the clogged sink in the toilet. Overall, I would not hesitate to fly again with them.",would not hesitate to fly again with them
Korean Air,"Hong Kong to Nadi, Fiji via Seoul. It was my first flight with Korean Air and it certainly is the last one. Whoever told me it is one of the best, seems to not have traveled with any other company apart from some Ryanair or American Airlines, which, ironically, are better than Korean Air as far as I am concerned.  My gluten free food - I don't know exactly what they put there, but my strong medicine couldn't help me. When I asked for half a lemon and warm water, which usually helps me a tiny bit at least to calm down when I am trapped on the plane without access to medical help, they gave me a small slice and were visibly annoyed when I asked for more lemon. The service onboard is outrageous. Air-hostesses are more concerned with how they look instead of how they work. Rude answers to simple questions, blocking the way to lavatory while reading something and ignoring me saying excuse me a few times, not even saying good bye when passengers were leaving the plane. These are just some examples. On top of those, my suitcase was broken. The mess they created out of this situation is unbelievable. There's nothing straightforward, even to proceed with compensation they ask you to sign a weird document to state you have already received the money (what?). To get the money, you need to go to the airport to get cash from their representative. Imagine being on a small island with a broken luggage not knowing where even to buy a new one that you will like and will not want to throw away to waste. Entertainment system is a joke. Definitely my last flight with them.",my last flight with them
Korean Air,"I recently travelled from Sydney to Prague (via Incheon) with Korean Air. The legroom on both legs was surprisingly good for economy. Food, service and entertainment were all first rate. The best though is the stopover in Incheon. Arrived late afternoon and taken to 5 star hotel in Incheon and provided with meal vouchers for dinner and breakfast. Plenty of time to walk around the centre of the city, have a great nights sleep and transfer back to the airport in the morning. Definitely the way to go to arrive in Europe fresh and rested. This was my first trip with this airline but it certainly wont be the last.",arrive in Europe fresh and rested
Korean Air,Washington to Seoul Incheon. The Korean Air counter service was horrible. Their kiosks was not working. When I got to the counter and weigh my 2 check in bags which is under the weight limit. Then she ask to weigh my carry on and laptop bag. She stated that my carry on combination was over the weight limitations. I ask her what do you mean? She said the combination of both bags should be under 12kg. While the gentlemen next checking in with me who has the same amount of luggages and carry on bags go in without his carry on bags being weigh. It cost me $100 for 5 pounds of extra weight. Lesson learn : Korean air pick and choose who ever they want to charge extra. And this is will be my last flight with Korean Air.,counter service was horrible
Korean Air,"Flight from Sao Paulo (GRU) to Los Angeles with Korean Air in business class. Old aircraft, Airbus A330. Old cabin. Departure was delayed 20 minutes. Very good service from the cabin crew. They even served one main course with the side dish of another main course. Service is attentive not intrusive. Arrived on time at LAX. Will fly again with Korean but only in newer aircraft.",very good service
Korean Air,"New York JFK to Tashkent via Seoul Incheon. This is the worst Asian airline I could ever flown. Customer service is inexistent. Business seat are small, not fully 180 degrees reclinable and lacking any other amenities (decent pillow, comforter, etc). The entertaining system is only good if you want to know your flight path, but the selection of movies is terribly old. Food, besides being mediocre for a business class, is 90% Korean. Beverages are average and limited. Female cabin crew were impossible to understand in English and clearly not there for foreigners or willing to accommodate anything you ask for. Be aware that if you, like in my case a Diamond Elite 360 Delta Skymiles member, or have an account with any Skyteam partner airline, you will not accrue elite qualifying miles, bonus miles, or extras. Korean Air just gives you base flown miles! There is no recognition for your elite status with other Skymiles partner airline. The business lounge at Incheon is awful. It is more like being in an open street bazar, and lacking any basic services. Avoid this airline at all cost. First and last experience for me. For the same ticket price, you have better options in Asia.",the worst Asian airline
Korean Air,"First time flying out of the country from San Francisco to Incheon and I had a great experience. Initially, there was a flight delay because the in-flight entertainment system needed rebooting, which is understandable considering the long 12 hour flight. Despite the delay, we made it to Incheon Int'l Airport on time. The flight attendants were attentive and nice, and I felt like a valued customer. Complimentary sleep masks, slippers, and a toothbrush and toothpaste were given as well. The food was really good, relative to what I expect of airplane food. We were served food twice, snacks twice, and refreshment beverages here and there. I found the meals to be quite balanced, each one containing the main proteins/carbs, side dish, and a slice of dessert. After looking around at cheaper options, I'm glad I went with my gut and booked with Korean Air. A 12 hour flight can be extremely uncomfortable, but it was very.",I felt like a valued customer
Korean Air,"Flown from Seattle to Incheon and then Incheon to Singapore with Korean Air. I was satisfied with the performance and service rendered by the ground crew in Seattle and Incheon. The seat (33A) was spacious by my standard (5' 5 and 130 pounds). Sufficient leg room. Even though the plane was full, there was sufficient overhead compartment space for every passenger to put their hand luggage/bags. Flight crew on both legs were friendly and attentive. Food wise, it was sufficient but the taste left much to be desired. KE does not provide packets of salt and pepper. Entertainment was limited (I'm being spoilt by the 100+ movies and TV shows on Emirates and Qatar Airways) and came only in 4 languages, predominantly English and Korean..",I was satisfied with the performance
Korean Air,"KE124, Brisbane to Incheon (A330) and KE867, Incheon to Ulaanbaatar (A330) with Korean Air. An uneventful flight which began with a quick check-in where I was recognised as an Alitalia Millemiglia Ulisse member with priority-check in and boarding. The flight itself was smooth until we were half-way into our journey from ICN to ULN when turbulent weather delayed the food service. The meals from ICN to BNE where a mixture of Asian and Western cuisine, while the food on the ICN to ULN leg were entirely Asian cuisine, comprising of chicken or beef with noodles. Overall, the food was of good quality. As for the IFE, I found the options to be reasonably plentiful to keep me occupied for the entire 15 hour trip. I would fly with Korean Air again.",an uneventful flight
Korean Air,"I flew Korean Air from Bali to Seoul in Prestige Class (Business Class). Though it is one of the longest intra-Asia routes (7 hours), the food and service onboard are both really poor. First of all, there is no proper meal to be served after taking off. Korean Air probably expects that all passengers would choose sleeping instead. For the first meal there was just one satay with two drops of hot sauce. For the second meal (breakfast) before landing, there was only one bowl of very watery congee with three different toppings. This was one of the worst catering experiences I have had. Secondly, the service was sloppy. The FA I interacted with was indifferent and didn't want to bothered. I also notice they only serve quarter glasses of champagne each time which is very annoying. So instead of giving you a full glass of champagne, they would serve it to you four times if you were consistent enough to keep calling them back. Other airlines like Thai would offer amenity kit for such a long flight but Korean Air didn’t offer anything. All in all, a waste of money.",didn’t offer anything
